\section{On the derivation of the GP predictive distribution}
\label{sec:Appendix_derivation_pred_dist}

This appendix gives a sketch of the procedure by which Eq.~(\ref{eq:predictive_distribution}) is obtained, which substantially relies on the properties of multivariate Gaussian distributions. For full details on this one can consult the excellent Refs.~\citep{Bishop:998831}~and~\citep{Williams:2006vz}.
