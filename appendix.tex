\section{Software developed}
\label{sec:Appendix_software}

The simulations and analysis of capzip systems prompted the development of tools to facilitate the task.
%
These are meant to be used in conjunction with standard analysis tools provided by GROMACS \citep{Berendsen1995,Abraham2015,gromacs_man} and MDAnalysis \citep{Michaud-Agrawal2011,Gowers2016}.
%
The scripts and packages developed can be found at \url{https://github.com/imarzuoli/MDtools}, which includes:
\begin{itemize}
\item python functions to perform the analysis of contacts as in Section \ref{sec:results_cap} of Chapter \ref{chapter:capzip_results} (\url{contacts_analysis.py});

\item functions to perform the hydration analysis as in Section 3.4 of Chapter \ref{chapter:lip_par} (\url{an_min_hist.py});
%\emph{delete_water.py}: a script to delete water molecules in a given slice of space (perpendicular to either x, y or z)

\item a python module to manipulate multi-branched peptide topology files in the GROMACS format for GROMOS simulations (\url{MD_mutate_and_manipulate.py}).

\end{itemize}
