\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
%%
%Many people have contributed to my scientific and personal growth throughout my PhD, and this thesis would have not been possible without them.
%
%First of all, Franca, an excellent scientist, supervisor and woman: she showed me how true enthusiasm for research, and life, can withstand the thousand everyday difficulties.
%
%Then, all the present and past members of the Fraternali's group: Anna, Carlos, Christian, Jamie, Joseph, Marius and Sun, each of you made the office a more enjoyable and scientifically stimulating place. A special thanks to Carlos and Christian, for great (and sometimes unexpected) collaborations, and to the people who shared these years at the same pace: Joseph, whose cheerfulness made working days and scientific discussions more pleasant (not to mention your delicious treats), and Marius, for the curious and caring attitude which granted great serendipitous conversations (and lunches in the sun).
%
%I am also grateful to my second supervisor, Chris, and all his group, for the concrete and prompt support on practical - or less practical - problems whenever I needed it.
%
%A big thank you to all the members of the CANES CDT, students and academics, for the community environment which pushed me to stay updated on all aspects of science. Among them, I want single out the ``italian core": for the warmth, the support, and encounters in all the corners of the world. In particular, thanks to Claudio, for his presence in good and bad moments, but mostly for introducing me to climbing and the Ronnie Scott's; to Aldo, for challenging my ideas about research, universe and everything; and finally to Carla, a colleague, a flatmate, a friend: navigating our job and every day life together made me a more serene person.
%
%Finally, my fondest gratitude goes to my parents. For supporting and trusting me in this adventure, without asking back anything, a part from brief stories of my research efforts - those were the only presentations I truly enjoyed giving.
