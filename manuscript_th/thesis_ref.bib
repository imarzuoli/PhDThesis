abstract = {Polymers have played an integral role in the advancement of drug delivery technology by providing controlled release of therapeutic agents in constant doses over long periods, cyclic dosage, and tunable release of both hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs. From early beginnings using off-the-shelf materials, the field has grown tremendously, driven in part by the innovations of chemical engineers. Modern advances in drug delivery are now predicated upon the rational design of polymers tailored for specific cargo and engineered to exert distinct biological functions. In this review, we highlight the fundamental drug delivery systems and their mathematical foundations and discuss the physiological barriers to drug delivery. We review the origins and applications of stimuli-responsive polymer systems and polymer therapeutics such as polymer-protein and polymer-drug conjugates. The latest developments in polymers capable of molecular recognition or directing intracellular delivery are surveyed to illustrate areas of research advancing the frontiers of drug delivery.},

abstract = {Abstract Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are promising novel antibiotics since they have shown antimicrobial activity against a wide range of bacterial species, including multiresistant bacteria; however, toxicity is the major barrier to convert antimicrobial peptides into active drugs. A profound and proper understanding of the complex interactions between these peptides and biological membranes using biophysical tools and model membranes seems to be a key factor in the race to develop a suitable antimicrobial peptide therapy for clinical use. In the search for such therapy, different combined approaches with conventional antibiotics have been evaluated in recent years and demonstrated to improve the therapeutic potential of AMPs. Some of these approaches have revealed promising additive or synergistic activity between AMPs and chemical antibiotics. This review will give an insight into the possibilities that physicochemical tools can give in the AMPs research and also address the state of the art on the current promising combined therapies between AMPs and conventional antibiotics, which appear to be a plausible future opportunity for AMPs treatment.},

abstract = {A novel folate-decorated and graphene mediated drug delivery system was prepared that involves uniquely combining graphene oxide (GO) with anticancer drug for controlled drug release. The nanocarrier system was synthesized by attaching doxorubicin (DOX) to graphene oxide via strong $\pi$–$\pi$ stacking interaction, followed by encapsulation of graphene oxide with folic acid conjugated chitosan. The $\pi$–$\pi$ stacking interaction, simplified as a non-covalent type of functionalization, enables high drug loading and subsequent controlled release of the drug. The encapsulated graphene oxide enhanced the stability of the nanocarrier system in aqueous medium because of the hydrophilicity and cationic nature of chitosan. The loading and release of DOX indicated strong pH dependence and imply hydrogen-bonding interaction between graphene oxide and DOX. The proposed strategy is advantageous in terms of targeted drug delivery and has high potential to address the current challenges in drug delivery. Thus, the prepared nanohybrid system offers a novel formulation that combines the unique properties of a biodegradable material, chitosan, and graphene oxide for biomedical applications.},

They are prepared using a remarkably simple galvanic replacement reaction between solutions containing metal precursor salts and Ag nanostructures prepared through polyol reduction. The electrochemical potential difference between the two species drives the reaction, with the reduced metal depositing on the surface of the Ag nanostructure. In our most studied example, involving HAuCl4 as the metal precursor, the resultant Au is deposited epitaxially on the surface of the Ag nanocubes, adopting their underlying cubic form. Concurrent with this deposition, the interior Ag is oxidized and removed, together with alloying and dealloying, to produce hollow and, eventually, porous structures that we commonly refer to as Au nanocages. This approach is versatile, with a wide range of morphologies (e.g., nanorings, prism-shaped nanoboxes, nanotubes, and multiple-walled nanoshells or nanotubes) available upon...},

abstract = {This study was conducted to assess the site of drug absorption in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract after oral administration. Drug permeability to different regions of rat intestine, jejunum, ileum and colon, was measured by in situ single-pass perfusion method. It was revealed that the epithelial surface area should not be a determinant of the regional difference in the intestinal permeability of highly permeable drugs. Effects of the mucus layer at the surface of the epithelium and the fluidity of the epithelial cell membrane on the drug permeability were investigated. These factors are demonstrated to contribute to the regional differences in intestinal drug permeability. The luminal drug concentration in each segment of the GI tract after oral administration was measured directly in fasted rats. Water ingested orally was absorbed quickly in the jejunum and the luminal fluid volume was diminished in the middle to lower part of the small intestine. According to the absorption of water luminal concentration of atenolol, a drug with low permeability, was elevated and exceeded the initial dose concentration. In contrast, the concentration of highly permeable drugs, antipyrine and metoprolol, decreased quickly in the upper part of the intestine and a significant amount of drugs was not detected in the lower jejunum and the ileum. From the time-profiles of luminal drug concentration, fraction of dose absorbed from each segment of the GI tract was calculated. Both antipyrine and metoprolol were found to be absorbed quickly at the upper part of the small intestine. In addition, the possible contribution of gastric absorption was demonstrated for these drugs. The pattern of site-dependent absorption of atenolol showed the higher absorbability in the middle and lower portion of the jejunum. These informations on site-dependent absorption of drugs are considered to be important for effective oral delivery systems.},

abstract = {Nanomedicine is a fast evolving field involving nanoparticles or nanostructures for medical applications. Especially in the underdeveloped field of drug delivery to the brain, there are high expectations for the ability of multifunctional nanoparticles (NPs) to cross the blood–brain barrier (BBB). In the present review the challenges nanoparticles face after injection into the body will be summarized. There is a broad range of biological, chemical and physical hurdles for NPs to reach the brain. Perhaps the most challenging task will be to design and develop nanoparticles that specifically target that right subset of diseased neurons without affecting other healthy neurons. This is of immense importance especially in the case of targeting toxic drugs to highly invasive brain tumors. Already, without the additional obstacle in the form of the BBB, targeting nanoparticles against a small subset of cells in the body is a big challenge. While the permeability of the blood vessels in other tissues is comparably higher the brain microvasculature is highly restrictive. The reason for this is that uncontrolled invasion of nano-objects or molecules may lead to a pathological change in neurons responsible for memory, personality, senses and movement. With nanomedicine we have for the first time the possibility to design systems to meet requirements such as reduced side-effects, controlled release, targeted delivery as well as higher drug bioavailability at the target site. If the brain delivery of drugs for neurodegenerative disease or cerebral cancer is to be successful, a far better understanding of the complex processes taking place on the nanoparticles surface, as well as in cell–NP contact with the different transit organs and tissues, will be required.},

Researchers have elucidated their roles in long-distance transport of a wide array of cargoes, such as proteins, toxins, antigens, virulence factors, microbicidal agents and antibiotics. Given that these natural carriers are important players in intercellular communication, it has been hypothesized that they are equally well attuned for transport and delivery of exogenous therapeutic cargoes. Additionally, BMVs appear to possess specific properties that enable their utilization as drug delivery vehicles. These include their ability to evade the host immune system, protection of the therapeutic payload and natural stability. Using bioengineering approaches, BMVs have been applied as carriers of therapeutic moieties in vaccines and for targeted delivery in cancer. In this article, we explore BMVs from the perspective of understanding their applicability to drug delivery. BMV biology, including biogenesis, physiology and pathology, is briefly reviewed. Practical issues related to bioprocessing, loading of therapeutic moieties and characterization for enabling scalability and commercial viability are evaluated. Finally, challenges to clinical translation and rational design approaches for novel BMV formulations are presented. Although the realization of the full potential of BMVs in drug delivery hinges on the development of scalable approaches for their production as well as the refinement of targeting and loading methods, they are promising candidates for development of a novel generation of drug delivery vehicles in future.},

abstract = {Chemotherapeutic agents have certain limitations when it comes to treating cancer, the most important being severe side effects along with multidrug resistance developed against them. Tumor cells exhibit drug resistance due to activation of various cellular level processes viz. activation of drug efflux pumps, anti-apoptotic defense mechanisms, etc. Currently, RNA interference (RNAi) based therapeutic approaches are under vibrant scrutinization to seek cancer cure. Especially small interfering RNA (siRNA) and micro RNA (miRNA), are able to knock down the carcinogenic genes by targeting the mRNA expression, which underlies the uniqueness of this therapeutic approach. Recent research focus in the regime of cancer therapy involves the engagement of targeted delivery of siRNA/miRNA in combinations with other therapeutic agents (such as gene, DNA or chemotherapeutic drug) for targeting permeability glycoprotein (P-gp), multidrug resistant protein 1 (MRP-1), B-cell lymphoma (BCL-2) and other targets that are mainly responsible for resistance in cancer therapy. RNAi-chemotherapeutic drug combinations have also been found to be effective against different molecular targets as well and can increase the sensitization of cancer cells to therapy several folds. However, due to stability issues associated with siRNA/miRNA suitable protective carrier is needed and nanotechnology based approaches have been widely explored to overcome these drawbacks. Furthermore, it has been univocally advocated that the co-delivery of siRNA/miRNA with other chemodrugs significantly enhances their capability to overcome cancer resistance compared to naked counterparts. The objective of this article is to review recent nanocarrier based approaches adopted for the delivery of siRNA/miRNA combinations with other anticancer agents (siRNA/miRNA/pDNA/chemodrugs) to treat cancer.},

abstract = {The self-assembly of proteins into highly ordered nanoscale architectures is a hallmark of biological systems. The sophis-ticated functions of these molecular machines have inspired the development of methods to engineer self-assembling protein nanostructures; however, the design of multi-component protein nanomaterials with high accuracy remains an outstanding challenge. Here we report a computational method for designing protein nanomaterials in which multiple copies of two distinct subunits co-assemble into a specific architecture. We use the method to design five 24-subunit cage-like protein nanomaterials in two distinct symmetric architectures and experimentally demonstrate that their structures are in close agreement with the computational design models. The accuracy of the method and the number and variety of two-component materials that it makes accessible suggest a route to the construction of functional protein nanomaterials tailored to specific applications. The unique functional opportunities afforded by protein self-assembly range from the dynamic cellular scaffolding provided by cytoskeletal proteins to the encapsulation, protection and delivery of viral genomes to new host cells by virus capsids. Although natural assemblies can be repurposed to perform new functions 1,2 , this strategy is limited to the structures of existing proteins, which may not be suited to a given appli-cation. To overcome this limitation, methods for designing novel self-assembling proteins are of considerable interest 3–6 . The central challenge in designing self-assembling proteins is to encode the information nec-essary to direct assembly in the structures of the protein building blocks. Although the complexity and irregularity of protein structures resulted in slow initial progress in this area, advances in computational protein design algorithms and new approaches such as metal-mediated assem-bly have recently yielded exciting results 6–16},

abstract = {Bone is a highly integrative and dynamic tissue of the human body. It is continually remodeled by bone cells such as osteoblasts, osteoclasts. When a fraction of a bone is damaged or deformed, stem cells and bone cells under the influence of several signaling pathways regulate bone regeneration at the particular locale. Effective therapies for bone defects can be met via bone tissue engineering which employs drug delivery systems with biomaterials to enhance cellular functions by acting on signaling pathways such as Wnt, BMP, TGF-$\beta$, and Notch. This review provides the current understanding of polymers/bioceramics/bioactive compounds as scaffolds in activation of signaling pathways for the formation of bone.},

abstract = {Symmetrical protein cages have evolved to fulfil diverse roles in nature, including compartmentalization and cargo delivery1, and have inspired synthetic biologists to create novel protein assemblies via the precise manipulation of protein–protein interfaces. Despite the impressive array of protein cages produced in the laboratory, the design of inducible assemblies remains challenging2,3. Here we demonstrate an ultra-stable artificial protein cage, the assembly and disassembly of which can be controlled by metal coordination at the protein–protein interfaces. The addition of a gold (i)-triphenylphosphine compound to a cysteine-substituted, 11-mer protein ring triggers supramolecular self-assembly, which generates monodisperse cage structures with masses greater than 2 MDa. The geometry of these structures is based on the Archimedean snub cube and is, to our knowledge, unprecedented. Cryo-electron microscopy confirms that the assemblies are held together by 120 S–Aui–S staples between the protein oligomers, and exist in two chiral forms. The cage shows extreme chemical and thermal stability, yet it readily disassembles upon exposure to reducing agents. As well as gold, mercury(ii) is also found to enable formation of the protein cage. This work establishes an approach for linking protein components into robust, higher-order structures, and expands the design space available for supramolecular assemblies to include previously unexplored geometries.},

abstract = {Infections account for a major cause of death throughout the developing world. This is mainly due to the emergence of newer infectious agents and more specifically due to the appearance of antimicrobial resistance. With time, the bacteria have become smarter and along with it, massive imprudent usage of antibiotics in clinical practice has resulted in resistance of bacteria to antimicrobial agents. The antimicrobial resistance is recognized as a major problem in the treatment of microbial infections. The biochemical resistance mechanisms used by bacteria include the following: antibiotic inactivation, target modification, altered permeability, and "bypass" of metabolic pathway. Determination of bacterial resistance to antibiotics of all classes (phenotypes) and mutations that are responsible for bacterial resistance to antibiotics (genetic analysis) are helpful. Better understanding of the mechanisms of antibiotic resistance will help clinicians regarding usage of antibiotics in different situations. This review discusses the mechanism of action and resistance development in commonly used antimicrobials.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION Bacteria within the family Enterobacteriaceae are important pathogens in nosocomial and community settings. Over the past two decades, antimicrobial resistance among Enterobacteriaceae dramatically escalated worldwide. The authors review the mechanisms of antimicrobial resistance among Enterobacteriaceae, epidemiology and global spread of resistance elements and discuss therapeutic options. AREAS COVERED An exhaustive search for literature relating to Enterobacteriaceae was performed using PubMed, using the following key words: Enterobacteriaceae; Klebsiella pneumoniae; Escherichia coli; antimicrobial resistance; plasmids; global epidemiology; carbapenemases (CPEs); extended spectrum $\beta$-lactamases (ESBLs) and multidrug resistance (MDR). EXPERT OPINION Enterobacteriaceae are inhabitants of intestinal flora and spread easily among humans (via hand carriage, contaminated food or water or environmental sources). Antimicrobial resistance may develop via plasmids, transposons or other mobile resistance elements. Mutations conferring resistance typically increase over time; the rate of increase is amplified by selection pressure from antibiotic use. Factors that enhance spread of antimicrobial resistance include: crowding; lack of hygiene; overuse and over-the-counter use of antibiotics; tourism; refugees and international travel. Clonal spread of resistant organisms among hospitals, geographic regions and continents has globally fueled the explosive rise in resistance. The emergence and widespread dissemination of MDR clones containing novel resistance elements (particularly ESBLs and CPEs) has greatly limited therapeutic options. In some cases, infections due to MDR Enterobacteriaceae are untreatable with existing antimicrobial agents. The authors discuss current and future therapeutic options for difficult-to-treat infections due to these organisms.},

The first documented case of infection caused by bacteria producing NDM occurred in 2008, although retrospective analyses of stored cultures have identified the gene encoding this enzyme (blaNDM) in Enterobacteriaceae isolated in 2006. Since its first description, NDM carbapenemase has been reported from 40 countries worldwide, encompassing all continents except South America and Antarctica. The spread of NDM has a complex epidemiology involving the spread of a variety of species of NDM-positive bacteria and the inter-strain, inter-species and inter-genus transmission of diverse plasmids containing blaNDM, with the latter mechanism having played a more prominent role to date. The spread of NDM illustrates that antibiotic resistance is a public health problem that transcends national borders and will require international cooperation between health authorities if it is to be controlled.},

Located on highly mobile genetic elements, these enzymes have established their presence in successful bacterial clones, signaling the prelude to a novel endemic era in the hospital setting. In such a context, prompt detection of carbapenemase-producing microorganisms seems warranted, not only for the selection of an appropriate antibiotic regimen, but also for organizing and implementing effective surveillance and infection control measures. However, issues regarding detection, confirmatory testing and characterization persist. Determination of carbapenemase production via susceptibility pattern interpretation may not always be feasible, confirmatory testing remains debatable and precise characterization is a challenge for the clinical laboratory. We aim to review the current situation from a laboratory point of view, highlighting the tools that have been proposed in an effort to help outline reliable screening and detection procedures, with inhibitor-based phenotypic testing as the cornerstone of these strategies, and discuss the necessity for implementing identification of possible producers in the everyday workflow.},

Subsequently, the term has been stretched to include: (i) enzymes with spectra similar to those of TEM and SHV mutants but derived from other sources, e.g., the CTX-M and VEB types; (ii) TEM and SHV mutants with borderline ESBL activity, e.g., TEM-12; and (iii) various beta-lactamases conferring wider resistance than their parent types but not meeting the definition for group 2be, e.g., OXA derivatives and mutant AmpC types with increased activity against cefepime.

abstract = {Multilocus sequence typing reveals that many bacterial species have a clonal structure and that some clones are widespread. This underlying phylogeny was not revealed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, a method better suited to short-term outbreak investigation. Some global clones are multiresistant and it is easy to assume that these have disseminated from single foci. Such conclusions need caution, however, unless there is a clear epidemiological trail, as with KPC carbapenemase-positive Klebsiella pneumoniae ST258 from Greece to northwest Europe. Elsewhere, established clones may have repeatedly and independently acquired resistance. Thus, the global ST131 Escherichia coli clone most often has CTX-M-15 extended-spectrum $\beta$-lactamase (ESBL), but also occurs without ESBLs and as a host of many other ESBL types. We explore this interaction of clone and resistance for E. coli, K. pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii- a species where three global lineages dominate--and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which shows clonal diversity, but includes the relatively 'tight' serotype O12/Burst Group 4 cluster that has proved adept at acquiring resistances--from PSE-1 to VIM-1 $\beta$-lactamases--for over 20 years. In summary, 'high-risk clones' play a major role in the spread of resistance, with the risk lying in their tenacity--deriving from poorly understood survival traits--and a flexible ability to accumulate and switch resistance, rather than to constant resistance batteries.},

abstract = {SUMMARY The spread of Enterobacteriaceae, primarily Klebsiella pneumoniae, producing KPC, VIM, IMP, and NDM carbapenemases, is causing an unprecedented public health crisis. Carbapenemase-producing enterobacteria (CPE) infect mainly hospitalized patients but also have been spreading in long-term care facilities. Given their multidrug resistance, therapeutic options are limited and, as discussed here, should be reevaluated and optimized. Based on susceptibility data, colistin and tigecycline are commonly used to treat CPE infections. Nevertheless, a review of the literature revealed high failure rates in cases of monotherapy with these drugs, whilst monotherapy with either a carbapenem or an aminoglycoside appeared to be more effective. Combination therapies not including carbapenems were comparable to aminoglycoside and carbapenem monotherapies. Higher success rates have been achieved with carbapenem-containing combinations. Pharmacodynamic simulations and experimental infections indicate that modification of the current patterns of carbapenem use against CPE warrants further attention. Epidemiological data, though fragmentary in many countries, indicate CPE foci and transmission routes, to some extent, whilst also underlining the lack of international collaborative systems that could react promptly and effectively. Fortunately, there are sound studies showing successful containment of CPE by bundles of measures, among which the most important are active surveillance cultures, separation of carriers, and assignment of dedicated nursing staff.},

abstract = {Antibiotic resistance can occur via three general mechanisms: prevention of interaction of the drug with target, efflux of the antibiotic from the cell, and direct destruction or modification of the compound. This review discusses the latter mechanisms focusing on the chemical strategy of antibiotic inactivation; these include hydrolysis, group transfer, and redox mechanisms. While hydrolysis is especially important clinically, particularly as applied to beta-lactam antibiotics, the group transfer approaches are the most diverse and include the modification by acyltransfer, phosphorylation, glycosylation, nucleotidylation, ribosylation, and thiol transfer. A unique feature of enzymes that physically modify antibiotics is that these mechanisms alone actively reduce the concentration of drugs in the local environment; therefore, they present a unique challenge to researchers and clinicians considering new approaches to anti-infective therapy. This review will present the current status of knowledge of these aspects of antibiotic resistance and discuss how a thorough understanding of resistance enzyme molecular mechanism, three-dimensional structure, and evolution can be leveraged in combating resistance.},

abstract = {Aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes (AGMEs) are expressed in many pathogenic bacteria and cause resistance to aminoglycoside (AG) antibiotics. Remarkably, the substrate promiscuity of AGMEs is quite variable. The molecular basis for such ligand promiscuity is largely unknown as there is not an obvious link between amino acid sequence or structure and the antibiotic profiles of AGMEs. To address this issue, this article presents the first kinetic and thermodynamic characterization of one of the least promiscuous AGMEs, the AG N3 acetyltransferase-IIa (AAC-IIa) and its comparison to two highly promiscuous AGMEs, the AG N3-acetyltransferase-IIIb (AAC-IIIb) and the AG phosphotransferase(3')-IIIa (APH). Despite having similar antibiotic selectivities, AAC-IIIb and APH catalyze different reactions and share no homology to one another. AAC-IIa and AAC-IIIb catalyze the same reaction and are very similar in both amino acid sequence and structure. However, they demonstrate strong differences in their substrate profiles and kinetic and thermodynamic properties. AAC-IIa and APH are also polar opposites in terms of ligand promiscuity but share no sequence or apparent structural homology. However, they both are highly dynamic and may even contain disordered segments and both adopt well-defined conformations when AGs are bound. Contrary to this AAC-IIIb maintains a well-defined structure even in apo form. Data presented herein suggest that the antibiotic promiscuity of AGMEs may be determined neither by the flexibility of the protein nor the size of the active site cavity alone but strongly modulated or controlled by the effects of the cosubstrate on the dynamic and thermodynamic properties of the enzyme.},

abstract = {Antimicrobial peptides and proteins (AMPs) are widespread in the living kingdom. They are key effectors of defense reactions and mediators of competitions between organisms. They are often cationic and amphiphilic, which favors their interactions with the anionic membranes of microorganisms. Several AMP families do not directly alter membrane integrity but rather target conserved components of the bacterial membranes in a process that provides them with potent and specific antimicrobial activities. Thus, lipopolysaccharides (LPS), lipoteichoic acids (LTA) and the peptidoglycan precursor Lipid II are targeted by a broad series of AMPs. Studying the functional diversity of immune effectors tells us about the essential residues involved in AMP mechanism of action. Marine invertebrates have been found to produce a remarkable diversity of AMPs. Molluscan defensins and crustacean anti-LPS factors (ALF) are diverse in terms of amino acid sequence and show contrasted phenotypes in terms of antimicrobial activity. Their activity is directed essentially against Gram-positive or Gram-negative bacteria due to their specific interactions with Lipid II or Lipid A, respectively. Through those interesting examples, we discuss here how sequence diversity generated throughout evolution informs us on residues required for essential molecular interaction at the bacterial membranes and subsequent antibacterial activity. Through the analysis of molecular variants having lost antibacterial activity or shaped novel functions, we also discuss the molecular bases of functional divergence in AMPs.

All peptides were able to penetrate into monolayers made with negatively charged phospholipids, but only two interacted weakly with neutral lipids. Peptide-mediated lipid flip-flop generally occurred at peptide concentrations that were 3- to 5-fold lower than those causing leakage of calcein across the membrane, regardless of peptide structure. With the exception of two alpha-helical peptides V681(n) and V25(p,) the extent of peptide-induced calcein release from large unilamellar liposomes was generally low at peptide/lipid molar ratios below 1:50. Peptide translocation across bilayers was found to be higher for the beta-sheet peptide polyphemusin, intermediate for alpha-helical peptides, and low for extended peptides. Overall, whereas all studied cationic antimicrobial peptides interacted with membranes, they were quite heterogeneous in their impact on these membranes.},

Much information suggests that AMPs act by mechanisms that extend beyond their capacity to serve as gene-encoded antibiotics. For example, some AMPs alter the properties of the mammalian membrane or interact with its receptors to influence diverse cellular processes including cytokine release, chemotaxis, antigen presentation, angiogenesis and wound healing. These functions complement their antimicrobial action and favor resolution of infection and repair of damaged epithelia. Opposing this, some microbes have evolved mechanisms to inactivate or avoid AMPs and subsequently become pathogens.

abstract = {Antimicrobial peptides have been isolated and characterized from tissues and organisms representing virtually every kingdom and phylum, ranging from prokaryotes to humans. Yet, recurrent structural and functional themes in mechanisms of action and resistance are observed among peptides of widely diverse source and composition. Biochemical distinctions among the peptides themselves, target versus host cells, and the microenvironments in which these counterparts convene, likely provide for varying degrees of selective toxicity among diverse antimicrobial peptide types. Moreover, many antimicrobial peptides employ sophisticated and dynamic mechanisms of action to effect rapid and potent activities consistent with their likely roles in antimicrobial host defense. In balance, successful microbial pathogens have evolved multifaceted and effective countermeasures to avoid exposure to and subvert mechanisms of antimicrobial peptides. A clearer recognition of these opposing themes will significantly advance our understanding of how antimicrobial peptides function in defense against infection. Furthermore, this understanding may provide new models and strategies for developing novel antimicrobial agents, that may also augment immunity, restore potency or amplify the mechanisms of conventional antibiotics, and minimize antimicrobial resistance mechanisms among pathogens. From these perspectives, the intention of this review is to illustrate the contemporary structural and functional themes among mechanisms of antimicrobial peptide action and resistance.},

They act by their relatively strong electrostatic attraction to the negatively charged bacterial cells and a relatively weak interaction to the eukaryote host cells. The ability of these peptides to accumulate at sites of infection combined with the minimal host's cytotoxicity motivated for this review to highlight the role and the usefulness of AMPs for PET with emphasis on their mechanism of action and the different interactions with the bacterial cell.

abstract = {Antimicrobial peptides encompass a number of different classes, including those that are rich in a particular amino acid. An important subset are peptides rich in Arg and Trp residues, such as indolicidin and tritrpticin, that have broad and potent antimicrobial activity. The importance of these two amino acids for antimicrobial activity was highlighted through the screening of a complete combinatorial library of hexapeptides. These residues possess some crucial chemical properties that make them suitable components of antimicrobial peptides. Trp has a distinct preference for the interfacial region of lipid bilayers, while Arg residues endow the peptides with cationic charges and hydrogen bonding properties necessary for interaction with the abundant anionic components of bacterial membranes. In combination, these two residues are capable of participating in cation-pi interactions, thereby facilitating enhanced peptide-membrane interactions. Trp sidechains are also implicated in peptide and protein folding in aqueous solution, where they contribute by maintaining native and nonnative hydrophobic contacts. This has been observed for the antimicrobial peptide from human lactoferrin, possibly restraining the peptide structure in a suitable conformation to interact with the bacterial membrane. These unique properties make the Arg- and Trp-rich antimicrobial peptides highly active even at very short peptide lengths. Moreover, they lead to structures for membrane-mimetic bound peptides that go far beyond regular alpha-helices and beta-sheet structures. In this review, the structures of a number of different Trp- and Arg-rich antimicrobial peptides are examined and some of the major mechanistic studies are presented.},

Ovispirin is a cathelicidin-like model peptide (NH(2)-KNLRRIIRKIIHIIKKYG-COOH) with potent, broad-spectrum bactericidal activity. (15)N NMR spectra of oriented ovispirin reconstituted into synthetic phospholipids show that the helical peptide is predominantly oriented in the plane of the lipid bilayer, except for a small portion of the helix, possibly at the C-terminus, which deviates from the surface orientation. This suggests differential insertion of the peptide backbone into the lipid bilayer. (15)N spectra of both oriented and unoriented peptides show a reduced (15)N chemical shift anisotropy at room temperature compared with that of rigid proteins, indicating that the peptide undergoes uniaxial rotational diffusion around the bilayer normal with correlation times shorter than 10(-4) s. This motion is frozen below the gel-to-liquid crystalline transition temperature of the lipids. Ovispirin interacts strongly with the lipid bilayer, as manifested by the significantly reduced (2)H quadrupolar splittings of perdeuterated palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine acyl chains upon peptide binding. Therefore, ovispirin is a curved helix residing in the membrane-water interface that executes rapid uniaxial rotation. These structural and dynamic features are important for understanding the antimicrobial function of this peptide.},

abstract = {Cecropins are positively charged antibacterial polypeptides that were originally isolated from insects. Later on a mammalian homologue, cecropin P1 (CecP), was isolated from pig intestines. While insect cecropins are highly potent against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, CecP is as active as insect cecropins against Gram-negative but has reduced activity against Gram-positive bacteria. To gain insight into the mechanism of action of CecP and the molecular basis of its antibacterial specificity, the peptide and its proline incorporated analogue (at the conserved position found in insect cecropins), P22-CecP, were synthesized and labeled on their N-terminal amino-acids with fluorescent probes, without significantly affecting their antibacterial activities. Fluorescence studies indicated that the N-terminal of CecP is located on the surface of phospholipid membranes. Binding experiments revealed that CecP binds acidic phosphatidylserine/phosphatidylcholine (PS/PC) vesicles better than zwitterionic PC vesicles, which correlates with its ability to permeate the former better than the latter. The shape of the binding isotherms suggest that CecP, like insect cecropin, binds phospholipids in a simple, noncooperative manner. However, resonance energy transfer (RET) measurements revealed that, unlike insect cecropins, CecP does not aggregate in the membrane even at relatively high peptide to lipid ratios. The stoichiometry of CecP binding to vesicles suggests that amount of CecP sufficient to form a monolayer causes vesicle permeation. In spite of the incorporation of the conserved proline in P22-CecP, the analogue has reduced antibacterial activity, which correlates with its reduced alpha-helical structure and its lower partitioning and membrane permeating activity with phospholipid vesicles. Taken together, our results support a mechanism in which CecP disrupts the structure of the bacterial membrane by (i) binding of peptide monomers to the acidic surface of the bacterial membrane and (ii) disintegrating the bacterial membrane by disrupting the lipid packing in the bilayers. These results, combined with data reported for other antibacterial polypeptides, suggest that the organization of peptide monomers within phospholipid membranes contributes to Gram-positive/Gram-negative antibacterial specificity.},

Antimicrobial peptides seem to be a promising solution to this problem. Many studies aimed at understanding their mode of action were described in the past few years. The most studied group includes the linear, mostly alpha-helical peptides. Although the exact mechanism by which they kill bacteria is not clearly understood, it has been shown that peptide-lipid interactions leading to membrane permeation play a role in their activity. Membrane permeation by amphipathic alpha-helical peptides can proceed via either one of the two mechanisms: (a) transmembrane pore formation via a "barrel-stave" mechanism; and (b) membrane destruction/solubilization via a "carpet-like" mechanism. The purpose of this review is to summarize recent studies aimed at understanding the mode of action of linear alpha-helical antimicrobial peptides. This review, which is focused on magainins, cecropins, and dermaseptins as representatives of the amphipathic alpha-helical antimicrobial peptides, supports the carpet-like rather the barrel-stave mechanism. That these peptides vary with regard to their length, amino acid composition, and next positive charge, but act via a common mechanism, may imply that other linear antimicrobial peptides that share the same properties also share the same mechanism.},

abstract = {Melittin (MLT), the 26-residue toxic peptide from the European honeybee Apis mellifera, is widely used for studying the principles of membrane permeabilization by antimicrobial and other host-defense peptides. A striking property of MLT is that its ability to permeabilize zwitterionic phospholipid vesicles is dramatically reduced upon the addition of anionic lipids. Because the mechanism of permeabilization may be fundamentally different for the two types of lipids, we examined MLT-induced release of entrapped fluorescent dextran markers of two different molecular masses (4 and 50 kDa) from anionic palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylglycerol (POPG) vesicles. Unlike release from palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine (POPC) vesicles, which is highly selective for the 4 kDa marker, implying release through pores of about 25 {\AA} diameter [Ladokhin et al., Biophys. J. 72 (1997) 1762], release from POPG vesicles was found to be non-selective, i.e., ‘detergent-like'. Oriented circular dichroism measurements of MLT in oriented POPG and POPC multilayers disclosed that $\alpha$-helical MLT can be induced to adopt a transbilayer orientation in POPC multilayers, but not in POPG multilayers. The apparent inhibition of MLT permeabilization by anionic membranes may thus be due to suppression of translocation ability.},

Some are linear, mostly helical, and others contain one or more disulfide bonds forming $\beta$-sheet or both $\beta$-sheet and $\alpha$-helix structures. They are all soluble in solution but when they reach the target membrane, conformational changes occur which let them associate with and lyse the membrane. Some lytic peptides are not cell-selective and lyse different microorganisms and normal mammalian cells, while others are specific to either type of cells. Despite extensive studies, the mode of action of membrane-lytic peptides is not fully understood and the basis for their selectivity towards specific target cells is not known. Many studies have shown that peptide-lipid interactions leading to membrane permeation play a major role in their activity. Membrane permeation by amphipathic $\alpha$-helical peptides has been proposed to occur via one of two general mechanisms: (i) transmembrane pore formation via a ‘barrel-stave' mechanism; and (ii) membrane destruction/solubilization via a ‘carpet' mechanism. This review, which is focused on the different stages of membrane permeation induced by representatives of amphipathic $\alpha$-helical antimicrobial and cell non-selective lytic peptides distinguishes between the ‘carpet' mechanism, which holds for antimicrobial peptides versus the ‘barrel-stave' mechanism, which holds for cell non-selective lytic peptides.},

abstract = {Magainin peptides, isolated from Xenopus skin, have broad spectra of antimicrobial activity and low toxicities to normal eukaryotic cells, thus being good candidates for therapeutic agents. The mechanism of action is considered to be the permeabilization of bacterial membranes. A number of studies using lipid vesicles have elucidated its molecular detail. However, their interactions with bacteria are not yet well understood. In this paper, we synthesized several magainin analogs with different charges (0 to +6) and hydrophobicities, and systematically studied their interactions with the outer and inner membranes of three species of Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Proteus vulgaris). The treatment of the E. coli cells with native magainin 2 (+4) immediately induced the efflux of the intracellular K+ ions and the cell death. A number of blebs were formed on the bacterial surface and the outer membrane became leaky. An increase in the peptide's positive charge enhanced the outer membrane permeabilization and the bactericidal activity. The cationic peptides also effectively permeabilized the inner membranes rich in acidic phospholipids, indicating the importance of electrostatic interactions. Substitution of Trp for Phe simultaneously increased the bactericidal activity and the hemolytic activity. A strategy to develop potent antimicrobial peptides was discussed on the basis of these results.},

abstract = {Antimicrobial peptides isolated from the host defense systems of animals have been shown to exert their activity directly on the lipid bilayer of cell membranes, but the antimicrobial mechanisms are not clear, due chiefly to the difficulty of discerning the high-order structures formed by these peptides in membranes. Previously we have shown that these peptides insert into the membrane when their concentrations exceed a lipid-dependent critical value. With neutron in-plane scattering we now show that inserted alamethicin creates aqueous pores approximately greater than 18 A in diameter. The density of pores is consistent with the assumption that all of the alamethicin is involved in pore formation. Pores were not detected below the critical concentration. Thus concentration-dependent pore formation appears to be the molecular mechanism of antimicrobial action.},

abstract = {In this work, we present the first characterization of the cell lysing mechanism of MSI-78, an antimicrobial peptide. MSI-78 is an amphipathic alpha-helical peptide designed by Genaera Corporation as a synthetic analog to peptides from the magainin family. (31)P-NMR of mechanically aligned samples and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) were used to study peptide-containing lipid bilayers. DSC showed that MSI-78 increased the fluid lamellar to inverted hexagonal phase transition temperature of 1,2-dipalmitoleoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine indicating the peptide induces positive curvature strain in lipid bilayers. (31)P-NMR of lipid bilayers composed of MSI-78 and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine demonstrated that the peptide inhibited the fluid lamellar to inverted hexagonal phase transition of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine, supporting the DSC results, and the peptide did not induce the formation of nonlamellar phases, even at very high peptide concentrations (15 mol {\%}). (31)P-NMR of samples containing 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-phosphatidylcholine and MSI-78 revealed that MSI-78 induces significant changes in the bilayer structure, particularly at high peptide concentrations. At lower concentrations (1-5{\%}), the peptide altered the morphology of the bilayer in a way consistent with the formation of a toroidal pore. Higher concentrations of peptide (10-15{\%}) led to the formation of a mixture of normal hexagonal phase and lamellar phase lipids. This work shows that MSI-78 induces significant changes in lipid bilayers via positive curvature strain and presents a model consistent with both the observed spectral changes and previously published work.},

Their intrinsic flip-flop half-lives at 30 degrees C in the absence of the peptide were 1.1 h, ca. 7 h, ca. 8 days, and {\textgreater} 2 days, respectively. The peptide accelerated the flip-flop half-lives of the fluorescent lipids to an order of minutes. Furthermore, the flip-flop was coupled with the membrane permeabilization and the peptide translocation [Matsuzaki, K., Murase, O., Fujii, N., {\&} Miyajima, K. (1995) Biochemistry 34, 6521-6526], suggesting pore-mediated flip-flop. The flip-flop rate was independent of the initial labeling conditions (outer leaflet label or inner leaflet label). From these results, a model was proposed, in which the lipids translocate across the membrane by lateral diffusion along the wall of the pores composed of the peptides and the lipids. A simple theoretical calculation could explain the coupling of the flip-flop with the permeabilization.},

As opposed to studies of the crystalline state, the polypeptide structures in the environment of fluid bilayers are difficult to probe. We have investigated the conformation of alamethicin in highly aligned stacks of model lipid membranes by synchrotron-based x-ray scattering. The (wide-angle) scattering distribution has been measured by reciprocal space mappings. A pronounced scattering signal is observed in samples of high molar peptide/lipid ratio which is distinctly different from the scattering distribution of an ideal helix in the transmembrane state. Beyond simple models of ideal helices, the data is analyzed in terms of models based on atomic coordinates from the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank, as well as from published molecular dynamics simulations. The results can be explained by assuming a wide distribution of helix tilt angles with respect to the membrane normal and a partial insertion of the N-terminus into the membrane.},

abstract = {Antimicrobial peptides are known to form pores in cell membranes. We study this process in model bilayers of various lipid compositions. We use two of the best-studied peptides, alamethicin and melittin, to represent peptides making two types of pores, that is, barrel-stave pores and toroidal pores. In both cases, the key control variable is the concentration of the bound peptides in the lipid bilayers (expressed in the peptide-lipid molar ratio, P/L). The method of oriented circular dichroism (OCD) was used to monitor the peptide orientation in bilayers as a function of P/L. The same samples were scanned by X-ray diffraction to measure the bilayer thickness. In all cases, the bilayer thickness decreases linearly with P/L and then levels off after P/L exceeds a lipid-dependent critical value, (P/L)*. OCD spectra showed that the helical peptides are oriented parallel to the bilayers as long as P/L {\textless} (P/L)*, but as P/L increases over (P/L)*, an increasing fraction of peptides changed orientation to become perpendicular to the bilayer. We analyzed the data by assuming an internal membrane tension associated with the membrane thinning. The free energy containing this tension term leads to a relation explaining the P/L-dependence observed in the OCD and X-ray diffraction measurements. We extracted the experimental parameters from this thermodynamic relation. We believe that they are the quantities that characterize the peptide-lipid interactions related to the mechanism of pore formation. We discuss the meaning of these parameters and compare their values for different lipids and for the two different types of pores. These experimental parameters are useful for further molecular analysis and are excellent targets for molecular dynamic simulation studies.},

abstract = {Transmembrane pores induced by amphiphilic peptides, including melittin, are often modeled with the barrel-stave model after the alamethicin pore. We examine this assumption on melittin by using two methods, oriented circular dichroism (OCD) for detecting the orientation of melittin helix and neutron scattering for detecting transmembrane pores. OCD spectra of melittin were systematically measured. Melittin can orient either perpendicularly or parallel to a lipid bilayer, depending on the physical condition and the composition of the bilayer. Transmembrane pores were detected when the helices oriented perpendicularly to the plane of the bilayers, not when the helices oriented parallel to the bilayers. The evidence that led to the barrel-stave model for alamethicin and that to the toroidal model for magainin were reviewed. The properties of melittin pores are closely similar to that of magainin but unlike that of alamethicin. We conclude that, among naturally produced peptides that we have investigated, only alamethicin conforms to the barrel-stave model. Other peptides, including magainins, melittin and protegrins, all appear to induce transmembrane pores that conform to the toroidal model in which the lipid monolayer bends continuously through the pore so that the water core is lined by both the peptides and the lipid headgroups.},

abstract = {Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) of innate origin are agents of the most ancient form of defense systems. They can be found in a wide variety of species ranging from bacteria through insects to humans. Through the course of evolution, host organisms developed arsenals of AMPs that protect them against a large variety of invading pathogens including both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. At a time of increasing bacterial resistance, AMPs have been the focus of investigation in a number of laboratories worldwide. Although recent studies show that some of the peptides are likely to have intracellular targets, the vast majority of AMPs appear to act by permeabilization of the bacterial cell membrane. Their activity and selectivity are governed by the physicochemical parameters of the peptide chains as well as the properties of the membrane system itself. In this review, we will summarize some of the recent developments that provide us with a better understanding of the mode of action of this unique family of antibacterial agents. Particular attention will be given to the determinants of AMP-lipid bilayer interactions as well as to the different pore formation mechanisms. The emphasis will be on linear AMPs but representatives of cysteine-bridged AMPs will also be discussed.},

An 11-residue linear peptide portion of LfcinB has been reported to have similar antimicrobial activity to lactoferricin itself, but with lower hemolytic activity. The membrane-binding and membrane-perturbing properties of this peptide were studied together with an amidated synthetic version with an added disulfide bond, which was designed to confer increased stability and possibly activity. The antimicrobial and cytotoxic properties of the peptides were measured against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli and by hemolysis assays. The peptides were also tested in an anti-cancer assay against neuroblastoma cell lines. Vesicle disruption caused by these LfcinB derivatives was studied using the fluorescent reporter molecule calcein. The extent of burial of the two Trp residues in membrane mimetic environments were quantitated by fluorescence. Finally, the solution NMR structures of the peptides bound to SDS micelles were determined to provide insight into their membrane bound state. The cyclic peptide was found to have greater antimicrobial potency than its linear counterpart. Consistent with this property, the two Trp residues of the modified peptide were suggested to be embedded deeper into the membrane. Although both peptides adopt an amphipathic structure without any regular alpha-helical or beta-sheet conformation, the 3D-structures revealed a clearer partitioning of the cationic and hydrophobic faces for the cyclic peptide.},

LfcinB is a 25-residue antimicrobial peptide released by pepsin cleavage of lactoferrin, an 80 kDa iron-binding glycoprotein with many immunologically important functions. The NMR structure of LfcinB reveals a somewhat distorted antiparallel beta-sheet. This contrasts with the X-ray structure of bovine lactoferrin, in which residues 1-13 (of LfcinB) form an alpha-helix. Hence, this region of lactoferricin B appears able to adopt a helical or sheetlike conformation, similar to what has been proposed for the amyloidogenic prion proteins and Alzheimer's beta-peptides. LfcinB has an extended hydrophobic surface comprised of residues Phe1, Cys3, Trp6, Trp8, Pro16, Ile18, and Cys20. The side chains of these residues are well-defined in the NMR structure. Many hydrophilic and positively charged residues surround the hydrophobic surface, giving LfcinB an amphipathic character. LfcinB bears numerous similarities to a vast number of cationic peptides which exert their antimicrobial activities through membrane disruption. The structures of many of these peptides have been well characterized, and models of their membrane-permeabilizing mechanisms have been proposed. The NMR solution structure of LfcinB may be more relevant to membrane interaction than that suggested by the X-ray structure of intact lactoferrin. Based on the solution structure, it is now possible to propose potential mechanisms for the antimicrobial action of LfcinB.},

Solution nuclear magnetic resonance analysis of the sapecin-phospholipid vesicle complex revealed the surface buried in the membrane and oligomerization surface on the sapecin molecule. The membrane-buried surface of sapecin was determined by observing the transferred cross-saturation phenomena from the alkyl chains of the phospholipid vesicle to the amide protons of sapecin. The membrane-buried surface contains basic and highly exposed hydrophobic residues, which are suitable for interacting with the acidic bacterial membrane. The oligomerization surface was also identified by comparisons between the results from hydrogen-deuterium exchange experiments and transferred cross-saturation experiments. On the basis of the results from the NMR experiments we built a putative model of sapecin oligomers, which provides insights into the membrane permeabilization caused by insect defensins.},

abstract = {Defensins, a family of cationic peptides isolated from mammalian granulocytes and believed to permeabilize membranes, were tested for their ability to cause fusion and lysis of liposomes. Unlike alpha-helical peptides whose lytic effects have been extensively studied, the defensins consist primarily of beta-sheet. Defensins fuse and lyse negatively charged liposomes but display reduced activity with neutral liposomes. These and other experiments suggest that fusion and lysis is mediated primarily by electrostatic forces and to a lesser extent, by hydrophobic interactions. Circular dichroism and fluorescence spectroscopy of native defensins indicate that the amphiphilic beta-sheet structure is maintained throughout the fusion process. Taken together, these results support the idea that protein-mediated membrane fusion depends not only on hydrophobic and electrostatic forces but also on the spatial arrangement of the amino acid residues to form a three-dimensional amphiphilic structure, which promotes the efficient mixing of the lipids between membranes. A molecular model for membrane fusion by defensins is presented, which takes into account the contributions of electrostatic forces, hydrophobic interactions, and structural amphiphilicity.},

The active peptide consists mainly of a loop of 18 amino acid residues, derived from the N-terminal region of the lactoferrin molecule. Like various other antimicrobial peptides that display membrane-disruptive properties, it contains a high proportion of basic amino acid residues. A physiologically diverse range of micro-organisms was tested and found to be susceptible to inhibition by this natural peptide including Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, yeasts and filamentous fungi. Its antimicrobial effect against sensitive micro-organisms was lethal. Electron microscopy studies revealed that it induces a profound change in cell ultrastructural features and causes substantial cell damage in bacteria and fungi. These findings suggest the possibility that active peptides of lactoferrin may have a role in the host defense against microbial disease. If produced in substantial quantities in vivo such peptides could have important physiological significance, especially in nursing infants.},

Successful pathogens have evolved mechanisms to withstand the antibiotic activity of these molecules. We have isolated a set of genes from Salmonella typhimurium which are required for virulence and resistance to the antimicrobial peptides melittin and protamine. Sequence analysis of a 5.7 kb segment from the wild-type plasmid conferring resistance to protamine contained five open reading frames: sapA, sapB, sapC, sapD and sapF, organized in an operon structure and transcribed as a 5.3 kb mRNA. SapD and SapF exhibited similarity with the 'ATP binding cassette' family of transporters including the bacterial Opp and SpoOK, involved in the uptake of oligopeptides; the yeast STE6, necessary for the export of a peptide pheromone; and the mammalian mdr, which mediates resistance to chemotherapeutic agents in cancer cells. SapA showed identity with other periplasmic solute binding proteins involved in peptide transport. The SapABCDF system constitutes a novel transporter for enteric bacteria and the first one harboring a periplasmic component with a role in virulence.},

abstract = {Epithelial linings serve as physical barriers and produce antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) to maintain host integrity. Examples are the bactericidal proteins midkine (MK) and BRAK/CXCL14 that are constitutively produced in the skin epidermal layer, where the anaerobic Gram-positive coccoid commensal Finegoldia magna resides. Consequently, this bacterium is likely to encounter both MK and BRAK/CXCL14, making these molecules possible threats to its habitat. In this study, we show that MK expression is upregulated during inflammation, concomitant with a strong downregulation of BRAK/CXCL14, resulting in changed antibacterial conditions. MK, BRAK/CXCL14, and the inflammation-dependent antimicrobial $\beta$-defensins human $\beta$-defensin (hBD)-2 and hBD-3 all showed bactericidal activity against both F. magna and the virulent pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes at similar concentrations. SufA, a released protease of F. magna, degraded MK and BRAK/CXCL14 but not hBD-2 nor hBD-3. Cleavage was seen at lysine and arginine residues, amino acids characteristic of AMPs. Intermediate SufA-degraded fragments of MK and BRAK/CXCL14 showed stronger bactericidal activity against S. pyogenes than F. magna, thus promoting survival of the latter. In contrast, the cysteine-protease SpeB of S. pyogenes rapidly degraded all AMPs investigated. The proteins FAF and SIC, released by F. magna and S. pyogenes, respectively, neutralized the antibacterial activity of MK and BRAK/CXCL14, protein FAF being the most efficient. Quantitation and colocalization by immunoelectron microscopy demonstrated significant levels and interactions of the molecules in in vivo and ex vivo samples. The findings reflect strategies used by a permanently residing commensal and a virulent pathogen, the latter operating during the limited time course of invasive disease.},

abstract = {$\alpha$-Defensins are peptides secreted by polymorphonuclear cells and provide antimicrobial protection mediated by disruption of the integrity of bacterial cell walls. Staphylokinase is an exoprotein produced by Staphylococcus aureus , which activates host plasminogen. In this study, we analyzed the impact of interaction between $\alpha$-defensins and staphylokinase on staphylococcal growth. We observed that staphylokinase induced extracellular release of $\alpha$-defensins from polymorphonuclear cells. Moreover, a direct binding between $\alpha$-defensins and staphylokinase was shown to result in a complex formation. The biological consequence of this interaction was an almost complete inhibition of the bactericidal effect of $\alpha$-defensins. Notably, staphylokinase with blocked plasminogen binding site still retained its ability to neutralize the bactericidal effect of $\alpha$-defensins. In contrast, a single mutation of a staphylokinase molecule at position 74, substituting lysine for alanine, resulted in a 50{\%} reduction of its $\alpha$-defensin-neutralizing properties. The bactericidal properties of $\alpha$-defensins were tested in 19 S. aureus strains in vitro and in a murine model of S. aureus arthritis. Staphylococcal strains producing staphylokinase were protected against the bactericidal effect of $\alpha$-defensins. When staphylokinase was added to staphylokinase-negative S. aureus cultures, it almost totally abrogated the effect of $\alpha$-defensins. Finally, human neutrophil peptide 2 injected intra-articularly along with bacteria alleviated joint destruction. In this study, we report a new property of staphylokinase, its ability to induce secretion of defensins, to complex bind them and to neutralize their bactericidal effect. Staphylokinase production may therefore be responsible in vivo for defensin resistance during S. aureus infections.},

abstract = {Cathelicidin LL-37 is one of the few human bactericidal peptides with potent antistaphylococcal activity. In this study we examined the susceptibility of LL-37 to proteolytic degradation by two major proteinases produced by Staphylococcus aureus, a metalloproteinase (aureolysin) and a glutamylendopeptidase (V8 protease). We found that aureolysin cleaved and inactivated LL-37 in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Analysis of the generated fragments by mass spectroscopy revealed that the initial cleavage of LL-37 by aureolysin occurred between the Arg19-Ile20, Arg23-Ile24, and Leu31-Val32 peptide bonds, instantly annihilating the antibacterial activity of LL-37. In contrast, the V8 proteinase hydrolyzed efficiently only the Glu16-Phe17 peptide bond, rendering the C-terminal fragment refractory to further degradation. This fragment (termed LL-17-37) displayed antibacterial activity against S. aureus at a molar level similar to that of the full-length LL-37 peptide, indicating that the antibacterial activity of LL-37 resides in the C-terminal region. In keeping with LL-37 degradation by aureolysin, S. aureus strains that produce significant amounts of this metalloprotease were found to be less susceptible to LL-17-37 than strains expressing no aureolysin activity. Taken together, these data suggest that aureolysin production by S. aureus contributes to the resistance of this pathogen to the innate immune system of humans mediated by LL-37.},

Vascular occlusive diseases, such as myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, and peripheral arterial occlusion are presently treated by thrombolytic intervention using staphylokinase, a plasminogen activator of bacterial origin. In this study we assessed a possible interaction between defensins and staphylokinase, both molecules being present in an acutely ill patient. Using an ELISA-based system, we found that staphylokinase and defensins displayed a strong and dose-dependent binding. In contrast, urokinase, another plasminogen activator of endogenous origin, displayed only minimal binding to defensins. Next, we proved that interaction between staphylokinase and defensins led to fuctional consequences resulting in a significant decrease (p{\textless}0.002) of plasminogen activation capacity upon complex formation. In contrast, urokinase retained most of its activity even in 10-fold molar excess of defensins. Finally, we found that staphylokinase-triggered lysis of fibrin was efficiently inhibited in the presence of defensins. To assess structural requirements for staphylokinase/defensin interaction, six staphylokinase mutant variants were studied. Inactivation pattern of the tested staphylokinase variants suggested a direct binding of defensins to serine protease-like domain of staphylokinase. In conclusion, we show complex formation between staphylokinase and $\alpha$-defensins resulting in a significant reduction of fibrinolytic activity. This finding may have clinical implications, since fibrinolytic effects of staphylokinase may be downregulated at the site of vascular occlusion.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {beta-Defensins are antimicrobial peptides that contribute to the innate immune responses of eukaryotes. At least three defensins, human beta-defensins 1, 2, and 3 (HBD-1, -2, and -3), are produced by epithelial cells lining the respiratory tract and are active toward Gram-positive (HBD-3) and Gram-negative (HBD-1, -2, and -3) bacteria. It has been postulated that the antimicrobial activity of defensins is compromised by changes in airway surface liquid composition in lungs of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), therefore contributing to the bacterial colonization of the lung by Pseudomonas and other bacteria in CF. In this report we demonstrate that HBD-2 and HBD-3 are susceptible to degradation and inactivation by the cysteine proteases cathepsins B, L, and S. In addition, we show that all three cathepsins are present and active in CF bronchoalveolar lavage. Incubation of HBD-2 and -3 with CF bronchoalveolar lavage leads to their degradation, which can be completely (HBD-2) or partially (HBD-3) inhibited by a cathepsin inhibitor. These results suggest that beta-defensins are susceptible to degradation and inactivation by host proteases, which may be important in the regulation of beta-defensin activity. In chronic lung diseases associated with infection, overexpression of cathepsins may lead to increased degradation of HBD-2 and -3, thereby favoring bacterial infection and colonization.},

Co-localization of LL-37 with extracellular actin was observed in necrotized regions of samples from oral lesions. Competition assays, cross-linking experiments, limited proteolysis, and mass spectrometry revealed that LL-37 binds by specific hydrophobic interactions to the His-40-Lys-50 segment of actin, located in the DNase I binding loop. The integrity of the binding site of both LL-37 and actin is a prerequisite to the binding. Our results demonstrate that actin, presumably released by dead cells and abundant in infected sites, might be utilized by the immune system to enhance spatio-temporal immunity in an attempt to arrest infection and control inflammation.},

The structure was created with virtual modeling software (AmiraMol), employing logical deduction as the primary investigative tool. A beta-sheet structure for the protein component is essentially mandated, as the alternatives can be decisively excluded. A dimeric structure too is essentially mandated, since the cysteine residues of protamines P1 and P2 are invariably aligned in all species having both chains. The cross-sectional and axial spacings of arginine guanidinium groups in this protein structure can be perfectly aligned with those of phosphate groups in DNA according to the DNA structure proposed by Wu. This is a non-helical structure, whose possible occurrence in certain plasmids has been suggested by experimental observations. The unit cell of this protamine-DNA complex is essentially devoid of steric hindrances, and heavily favored by a multitude of ionic and hydrogen bonds. The packing of adjacent "unit cells" of the protamine-DNA structure is based on a complex array of salt bridges, the mere existence of which is so fortuitous that it is virtually inconceivable that it comes about through a mere modeling "coincidence". The possible significance of the structure beyond the sperm cell is discussed.},

The disulfide structure of HNP-2 was determined using a novel method to identify the cross-links involving the amino- and carboxyl-terminal cysteine residues. A derivative of HNP-2 was synthesized by covalent modification of the terminal cysteine residues. This derivative was purified, characterized, and subjected to exhaustive proteolytic digestion. Characterization of purified proteolytic fragments by amino acid analysis and/or sequence analysis identified an oligopeptide containing all 6 cystine residues. This oligopeptide was subjected to a single cycle of Edman degradation to cleave the peptide bond linking 2 adjacent cysteines. Purification and characterization of the Edman reaction products allowed for assignment of the disulfide array in HNP-2, revealing a cystine motif unique to the defensin peptide family. Further, the covalent structure of HNP-2 was found to be cyclic as one disulfide links the amino- and carboxyl-terminal cysteine residues. HNP-2 is the only polypeptide known to possess such a configuration.},

Because of its relatively indiscriminant specificity, this enzyme has been shown to degrade the extracellular matrix, cytokines, chemokines, complement components, immunoglobulins, and serum protease inhibitors, to name but a few of the known substrates. Additionally, SpeB regulates other streptococcal proteins by degrading them or releasing them from the bacterial surface. Despite the wealth of literature on putative SpeB functions, there remains much controversy about this enzyme because many of reported activities would produce contradictory physiological results.

abstract = {Production of a polysaccharide matrix is a hallmark of bacterial biofilms, but the composition of matrix polysaccharides and their functions are not widely understood. Previous studies of the regulation of Escherichia coli biofilm formation suggested the involvement of an unknown adhesin. We now establish that the pgaABCD (formerly ycdSRQP) locus affects biofilm development by promoting abiotic surface binding and intercellular adhesion. All of the pga genes are required for optimal biofilm formation under a variety of growth conditions. A pga-dependent cell-bound polysaccharide was isolated and determined by nuclear magnetic resonance analyses to consist of unbranched beta-1,6-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine, a polymer previously unknown from the gram-negative bacteria but involved in adhesion by staphylococci. The pga genes are predicted to encode envelope proteins involved in synthesis, translocation, and possibly surface docking of this polysaccharide. As predicted, if poly-beta-1,6-GlcNAc (PGA) mediates cohesion, metaperiodate caused biofilm dispersal and the release of intact cells, whereas treatment with protease or other lytic enzymes had no effect. The pgaABCD operon exhibits features of a horizontally transferred locus and is present in a variety of eubacteria. Therefore, we propose that PGA serves as an adhesin that stabilizes biofilms of E. coli and other bacteria.},

abstract = {Biofilms are communities of microorganisms attached to a surface. It has become clear that biofilm-grown cells express properties distinct from planktonic cells, one of which is an increased resistance to antimicrobial agents. Recent work has indicated that slow growth and/or induction of an rpoS-mediated stress response could contribute to biocide resistance. The physical and/or chemical structure of exopolysaccharides or other aspects of biofilm architecture could also confer resistance by exclusion of biocides from the bacterial community. Finally, biofilm-grown bacteria might develop a biofilm-specific biocide-resistant phenotype. Owing to the heterogeneous nature of the biofilm, it is likely that there are multiple resistance mechanisms at work within a single community. Recent research has begun to shed light on how and why surface-attached microbial communities develop resistance to antimicrobial agents.},

After this colonization, sterile artificial urine containing 1,000 micrograms of tobramycin per ml was flowed past this established biofilm, and a significant proportion of the bacterial cells within the biofilm were found to be still viable after 12 h of exposure to this very high concentration of aminoglycoside antibiotic. Planktonic (floating) cells taken from the test system just before the exposure of the biofilm to the antibiotic were completely killed by 50 micrograms of tobramycin per ml. The MIC of tobramycin for cells taken from the seeding cultures before colonization of the catheter material, and for surviving cells recovered directly from the tobramycin-treated biofilm, was found to be 0.4 micrograms/ml when dispersed cells were assayed by standard methods. These data indicate that growth within thick adherent biofilms confers a measure of tobramycin resistance on cells of P. aeruginosa.},

abstract = {Antimicrobial peptides (APs) are important host weapons against infections. Nearly all APs are cationic and their microbicidal action is initiated through interactions with the anionic bacterial surface. It is known that pathogens have developed countermeasures to resist these agents by reducing the negative charge of membranes, by active efflux and by proteolytic degradation. Here we uncover a new strategy of resistance based on the neutralization of the bactericidal activity of APs by anionic bacterial capsule polysaccharide (CPS). Purified CPSs from Klebsiella pneumoniae K2, Streptococcus pneumoniae serotype 3 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa increased the resistance to polymyxin B of an unencapsulated K. pneumoniae mutant. Furthermore, these CPSs increased the MICs of polymyxin B and human neutrophil alpha-defensin 1 (HNP-1) for unencapsulated K. pneumoniae, Escherichia coli and P. aeruginosa PAO1. Polymyxin B or HNP-1 released CPS from capsulated K. pneumoniae, S. pneumoniae serotype 3 and P. aeruginosa overexpressing CPS. Moreover, this material also reduced the bactericidal activity of APs. We postulate that APs may trigger in vivo the release of CPS, which in turn will protect bacteria against APs. We found that anionic CPSs, but not cationic or uncharged ones, blocked the bactericidal activity of APs by binding them, thereby reducing the amount of peptides reaching the bacterial surface. Supporting this, polycations inhibited such interaction and the bactericidal activity was restored. We postulate that trapping of APs by anionic CPSs is an additional selective virulence trait of these molecules, which could be considered as bacterial decoys for APs.},

On the other hand, it is known that pathogenic organisms have developed countermeasures to resist these agents such as reducing the net negative charge of the bacterial membranes. Here we report the characterization of a novel mechanism of resistance to APs that is dependent on the bacterial capsule polysaccharide (CPS). Klebsiella pneumoniae CPS mutant was more sensitive than the wild type to human neutrophil defensin 1, beta-defensin 1, lactoferrin, protamine sulfate, and polymyxin B. K. pneumoniae lipopolysaccharide O antigen did not play an important role in AP resistance, and CPS was the only factor conferring protection against polymyxin B in strains lacking O antigen. In addition, we found a significant correlation between the amount of CPS expressed by a given strain and the resistance to polymyxin B. We also showed that K. pneumoniae CPS mutant bound more polymyxin B than the wild-type strain with a concomitant increased in the self-promoted pathway. Taken together, our results suggest that CPS protects bacteria by limiting the interaction of APs with the surface. Finally, we report that K. pneumoniae increased the amount of CPS and upregulated cps transcription when grown in the presence of polymyxin B and lactoferrin.},

abstract = {Biofilms play an important role in many chronic bacterial infections. Production of an extracellular mixture of sugar polymers called exopolysaccharide is characteristic and critical for biofilm formation. However, there is limited information about the mechanisms involved in the biosynthesis and modification of exopolysaccharide components and how these processes influence bacterial pathogenesis. Staphylococcus epidermidis is an important human pathogen that frequently causes persistent infections by biofilm formation on indwelling medical devices. It produces a poly-N-acetylglucosamine molecule that emerges as an exopolysaccharide component of many bacterial pathogens. Using a novel method based on size exclusion chromatography-mass spectrometry, we demonstrate that the surface-attached protein IcaB is responsible for deacetylation of the poly-N-acetylglucosamine molecule. Most likely due to the loss of its cationic character, non-deacetylated poly-acetylglucosamine in an isogenic icaB mutant strain was devoid of the ability to attach to the bacterial cell surface. Importantly, deacetylation of the polymer was essential for key virulence mechanisms of S. epidermidis, namely biofilm formation, colonization, and resistance to neutrophil phagocytosis and human antibacterial peptides. Furthermore, persistence of the icaB mutant strain was significantly impaired in a murine model of device-related infection. This is the first study to describe a mechanism of exopolysaccharide modification that is indispensable for the development of biofilm-associated human disease. Notably, this general virulence mechanism is likely similar for other pathogenic bacteria and constitutes an excellent target for therapeutic maneuvers aimed at combating biofilm-associated infection.},

abstract = {Virus-host biological interaction is a continuous coevolutionary process involving both host immune system and viral escape mechanisms. Flaviviridae family is composed of fast evolving RNA viruses that infects vertebrate (mammals and birds) and/or invertebrate (ticks and mosquitoes) organisms. These host groups are very distinct life forms separated by a long evolutionary time, so lineage-specific anti-viral mechanisms are likely to have evolved. Flaviviridae viruses which infect a single host lineage would be subjected to specific host-induced pressures and, therefore, selected by them. In this work we compare the genomic evolutionary patterns of Flaviviridae viruses and their hosts in an attempt to uncover coevolutionary processes inducing common features in such disparate groups. Especially, we have analyzed dinucleotide and codon usage patterns in the coding regions of vertebrate and invertebrate organisms as well as in Flaviviridae viruses which specifically infect one or both host types. The two host groups possess very distinctive dinucleotide and codon usage patterns. A pronounced CpG under-representation was found in the vertebrate group, possibly induced by the methylation-deamination process, as well as a prominent TpA decrease. The invertebrate group displayed only a TpA frequency reduction bias. Flaviviridae viruses mimicked host nucleotide motif usage in a host-specific manner. Vertebrate-infecting viruses possessed under-representation of CpG and TpA, and insect-only viruses displayed only a TpA under-representation bias. Single-host Flaviviridae members which persistently infect mammals or insect hosts (Hepacivirus and insect-only Flavivirus, respectively) were found to posses a codon usage profile more similar to that of their hosts than to related Flaviviridae. We demonstrated that vertebrates and mosquitoes genomes are under very distinct lineage-specific constraints, and Flaviviridae viruses which specifically infect these lineages appear to be subject to the same evolutionary pressures that shaped their host coding regions, evidencing the lineage-specific coevolutionary processes between the viral and host groups.},

Membranes of Francisella novicida (an environmental strain related to F. tularensis) contain enzymes that dephosphorylate lipid A and its precursors at the 1- and 4'-positions. We now report the cloning and characterization of a membrane-bound phosphatase of F. novicida that selectively dephosphorylates the 1-position. By transferring an F. novicida genomic DNA library into E. coli and selecting for low level polymyxin resistance, we isolated FnlpxE as the structural gene for the 1-phosphatase, an inner membrane enzyme of 239 amino acid residues. Expression of FnlpxE in a heptose-deficient mutant of E. coli caused massive accumulation of a previously uncharacterized LPS molecule, identified by mass spectrometry as 1-dephospho-Kdo2-lipid A. The predicted periplasmic orientation of the FnLpxE active site suggested that LPS export might be required for 1-dephosphorylation of lipid A. LPS and phospholipid export depend on the activity of MsbA, an essential inner membrane ABC transporter. Expression of FnlpxE in the msbA temperature-sensitive E. coli mutant WD2 resulted in 90{\%} 1-dephosphorylation of lipid A at the permissive temperature (30 degrees C). However, the 1-phosphate group of newly synthesized lipid A was not cleaved at the nonpermissive temperature (44 degrees C). Our findings provide the first direct evidence that lipid A 1-dephosphorylation catalyzed by LpxE occurs on the periplasmic surface of the inner membrane.},

Like staphylococcal MprF, we found that Lmo1695 is involved in the synthesis of the membrane phospholipid lysylphosphatidylglycerol (L-PG). In addition, Lmo1695 is also essential for lysinylation of diphosphatidylglycerol (DPG), another phospholipid widely distributed in bacterial membranes. A Deltalmo1695 mutant lacking the lysinylated phospholipids was particularly susceptible to CAMPs of human and bacterial origin. The mutant strain infected both epithelial cells and macrophages only poorly and was attenuated for virulence when tested in a mouse model of infection.

abstract = {Defensins, antimicrobial peptides of the innate immune system, protect human mucosal epithelia and skin against microbial infections and are produced in large amounts by neutrophils. The bacterial pathogen Staphylococcus aureus is insensitive to defensins by virtue of an unknown resistance mechanism. We describe a novel staphylococcal gene, mprF, which determines resistance to several host defense peptides such as defensins and protegrins. An mprF mutant strain was killed considerably faster by human neutrophils and exhibited attenuated virulence in mice, indicating a key role for defensin resistance in the pathogenicity of S. aureus. Analysis of membrane lipids demonstrated that the mprF mutant no longer modifies phosphatidylglycerol with l-lysine. As this unusual modification leads to a reduced negative charge of the membrane surface, MprF-mediated peptide resistance is most likely based on repulsion of the cationic peptides. Accordingly, inactivation of mprF led to increased binding of antimicrobial peptides by the bacteria. MprF has no similarity with genes of known function, but related genes were identified in the genomes of several pathogens including Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterococcus faecalis. MprF thus constitutes a novel virulence factor, which may be of general relevance for bacterial pathogens and represents a new target for attacking multidrug resistant bacteria.},

We now demonstrate that a membrane-bound phosphatase present in Francisella novicida U112 selectively removes the 4'-phosphate residue from tetra- and pentaacylated lipid A molecules. A clone that expresses the F. novicida 4'-phosphatase was identified by assaying lysates of E. coli colonies, harboring members of an F. novicida genomic DNA library, for 4'-phosphatase activity. Sequencing of a 2.5-kb F. novicida DNA insert from an active clone located the structural gene for the 4'-phosphatase, designated lpxF. It encodes a protein of 222 amino acid residues with six predicted membrane-spanning segments. Rhizobium leguminosarum and Rhizobium etli contain functional lpxF orthologues, consistent with their lipid A structures. When F. novicida LpxF is expressed in an E. coli LpxM mutant, a strain that synthesizes pentaacylated lipid A, over 90{\%} of the lipid A molecules are dephosphorylated at the 4'-position. Expression of LpxF in wild-type E. coli has no effect, because wild-type hexaacylated lipid A is not a substrate. However, newly synthesized lipid A is not dephosphorylated in LpxM mutants by LpxF when the MsbA flippase is inactivated, indicating that LpxF faces the outer surface of the inner membrane. The availability of the lpxF gene will facilitate re-engineering lipid A structures in diverse bacteria.},

These resistance mechanisms can be critical contributors to bacterial virulence and are often crucial for survival within the host. Here, we summarize methods used by Gram-negative bacteria to resist CAMPs. Understanding these mechanisms may lead to new therapeutic strategies against pathogens with extensive CAMP resistance.},

abstract = {To understand the role of cell membrane phospholipids during resistance development to cationic antimicrobial peptides (CAMPs) in Enterococcus faecalis, gradual dose-dependent single exposure pediocin-resistant (Pedr) mutants of E. faecalis (Efv2.1, Efv3.1, Efv3.2, Efv4.1, Efv4.2, Efv5.1, Efv5.2 and Efv5.3), conferring simultaneous resistance to other CAMPs, selected in previous study were characterized for cell membrane phospholipid head-groups and fatty acid composition. The involvement of phospholipids in resistance acquisition was confirmed by in vitro colorimetric assay using PDA (polydiacetylene)-biomimetic membranes. Estimation of ratio of amino-containing phospholipids to amino-lacking phospholipids suggests that phospholipids in cell membrane of Pedr mutants loose anionic character. At moderate level of resistance, the cell-membrane becomes neutralized while at further higher level of resistance, the cell-surface acquired positive charge. Increased expression of mprF gene (responsible for lysinylation of phospholipids) was also observed on acquiring resistance to pediocin in PedrE. faecalis. Decreased level of branched chain fatty acids in Pedr mutants might have contributed in enhancing rigidification of cell membrane and contributing towards resistance. The interaction of pediocin with PDA-biomimetic membranes prepared from wild-type and Pedr mutants was monitored by measuring percent colorimetric response ({\%}CR). Increased {\%}CR of pediocin against PDA-biomimetic membranes prepared from Pedr mutants confirmed that cell membrane phospholipids are involved in the interactions of pore formation by CAMPs. There was a direct linear relationship between percent colorimetric response and IC50 of CAMPs for wild-type and Pedr mutants. This relationship further reveals that in vitro colorimetric assay can be used effectively for quantification of resistance to CAMPs.},

abstract = {The O antigen of Brucella abortus has been described as a major virulence determinant based on the attenuated survival of fortuitously isolated rough variants. However, the lack of genetic definition of these mutants and the virulence of naturally occurring rough species, Brucella ovis and Brucella canis, has confused interpretation. To better characterize the role of O antigen in virulence and survival, transposon mutagenesis was used to generate B. abortus rough mutants defective in O-antigen presentation. Sequence analysis of DNA flanking the site of Tn5 insertion was used to verify insertion in genes encoding lipopolysaccharide (LPS) biosynthetic functions. Not surprisingly, each of the rough mutants was attenuated for survival in mice, but unexpected differences among the mutants were observed. In an effort to define the basis for the observed differences, the structure of the rough LPS and the sensitivity of these mutants to individual killing mechanisms were examined in vitro. All of the B. abortus rough mutants exhibited a 4- to 5-log-unit increase, compared to the smooth parental strain, in sensitivity to complement-mediated lysis. Little change was evident in the sensitivity of these organisms to hydrogen peroxide, consistent with an inability of O antigen to exclude relatively small molecules. Sensitivity to polymyxin B, which was employed as a model cationic, amphipathic peptide similar to defensins found in phagocytic cells, revealed survival differences among the rough mutants similar to those observed in the mouse. One mutant in particular exhibited hypersensitivity to polymyxin B and reduced survival in mice. This mutant was characterized by a truncated rough LPS. DNA sequence analysis of this mutant revealed a transposon interruption in the gene encoding phosphomannomutase (pmm), suggesting that this activity may be required for the synthesis of a full-length core polysaccharide in addition to O antigen. B. abortus O antigen appears to be essential for extra- and intracellular survival in mice.},

abstract = {Burkholderia cenocepacia is an important opportunistic pathogen of patients with cystic fibrosis. This bacterium is inherently resistant to a wide range of antimicrobial agents, including high concentrations of antimicrobial peptides. We hypothesized that the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of B. cenocepacia is important for both virulence and resistance to antimicrobial peptides. We identified hldA and hldD genes in B. cenocepacia strain K56-2. These two genes encode enzymes involved in the modification of heptose sugars prior to their incorporation into the LPS core oligosaccharide. We constructed a mutant, SAL1, which was defective in expression of both hldA and hldD, and by performing complementation studies we confirmed that the functions encoded by both of these B. cenocepacia genes were needed for synthesis of a complete LPS core oligosaccharide. The LPS produced by SAL1 consisted of a short lipid A-core oligosaccharide and was devoid of O antigen. SAL1 was sensitive to the antimicrobial peptides polymyxin B, melittin, and human neutrophil peptide 1. In contrast, another B. cenocepacia mutant strain that produced complete lipid A-core oligosaccharide but lacked polymeric O antigen was not sensitive to polymyxin B or melittin. As determined by the rat agar bead model of lung infection, the SAL1 mutant had a survival defect in vivo since it could not be recovered from the lungs of infected rats 14 days postinfection. Together, these data show that the B. cenocepacia LPS inner core oligosaccharide is needed for in vitro resistance to three structurally unrelated antimicrobial peptides and for in vivo survival in a rat model of chronic lung infection.},

The Salmonella typhimurium PhoP/PhoQ-activated gene pagP is required both for biosynthesis of hepta-acylated lipid A species containing palmitate and for resistance to cationic anti-microbial peptides. Palmitoylated lipid A can also function as an endotoxin antagonist. We now show that pagP and its Escherichia coli homolog (crcA) encode an unusual enzyme of lipid A biosynthesis localized in the outer membrane. PagP transfers a palmitate residue from the sn-1 position of a phospholipid to the N-linked hydroxymyristate on the proximal unit of lipid A (or its precursors). PagP bearing a C-terminal His(6)-tag accumulated in outer membranes during overproduction, was purified with full activity and was shown by cross-linking to behave as a homodimer. PagP is the first example of an outer membrane enzyme involved in lipid A biosynthesis. Additional pagP homologs are encoded in the genomes of Yersinia and Bordetella species. PagP may provide an adaptive response toward both Mg(2+) limitation and host innate immune defenses.},

abstract = {It is generally assumed that type A lantibiotics primarily kill bacteria by permeabilization of the cytoplasmic membrane. As previous studies had demonstrated that nisin interacts with the membrane-bound peptidoglycan precursors lipid I and lipid II, we presumed that this interaction could play a role in the pore formation process of lantibiotics. Using a thin-layer chromatography system, we found that only nisin and epidermin, but not Pep5, can form a complex with [14C]-lipid II. Lipid II was then purified from Micrococcus luteus and incorporated into carboxyfluorescein-loaded liposomes made of phosphatidylcholine and cholesterol (1:1). Liposomes supplemented with 0.05 or 0.1 mol{\%} of lipid II did not release any marker when treated with Pep5 or epilancin K7 (peptide concentrations of up to 5 mol{\%} were tested). In contrast, as little as 0.01 mol{\%} of epidermin and 0.1 mol{\%} of nisin were sufficient to induce rapid marker release; phosphatidylglycerol-containing liposomes were even more susceptible. Controls with moenomycin-, undecaprenol- or dodecaprenolphosphate-doped liposomes demonstrated the specificity of the lantibiotics for lipid II. These results were correlated with intact cells in an in vivo model. M. luteus and Staphylococcus simulans were depleted of lipid II by preincubation with the lipopeptide ramoplanin and then tested for pore formation. When applied in concentrations below the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and up to 5-10 times the MIC, the pore formation by nisin and epidermin was blocked; at higher concentrations of the lantibiotics the protective effect of ramoplanin disappeared. These results demonstrate that, in vitro and in vivo, lipid II serves as a docking molecule for nisin and epidermin, but not for Pep5 and epilancin K7, and thereby facilitates the formation of pores in the cytoplasmic membrane.},

abstract = {Antimicrobial peptides are distributed throughout the animal kingdom and are a key component of innate immunity. Salmonella typhimurium regulates mechanisms of resistance to cationic antimicrobial peptides through the two-component systems PhoP-PhoQ and PmrA-PmrB. Polymyxin resistance is encoded by the PmrA-PmrB regulon, whose products modify the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) core and lipid A regions with ethanolamine and add aminoarabinose to the 4' phosphate of lipid A. Two PmrA-PmrB-regulated S. typhimurium loci (pmrE and pmrF) have been identified that are necessary for resistance to polymyxin and for the addition of aminoarabinose to lipid A. One locus, pmrE, contains a single gene previously identified as pagA (or ugd) that is predicted to encode a UDP-glucose dehydrogenase. The second locus, pmrF, is the second gene of a putative operon predicted to encode seven proteins, some with similarity to glycosyltransferases and other complex carbohydrate biosynthetic enzymes. Genes immediately flanking this putative operon are also regulated by PmrA-PmrB and/or have been associated with S. typhimurium polymyxin resistance. This work represents the first identification of non-regulatory genes necessary for modification of lipid A and subsequent antimicrobial peptide resistance, and provides support for the hypothesis that lipid A aminoarabinose modification promotes resistance to cationic antimicrobial peptides.},

Surface molecules like d-alanine lipoteichoic acid (LTA) perform several functions in gram-positive bacteria, such as maintenance of cationic homeostasis and modulation of autolytic activities. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of d-alanine esters of teichoic acids on biofilm production and adhesion, autolysis, antimicrobial peptide sensitivity, and opsonic killing. A deletion mutant of the dltA gene was created in a clinical E. faecalis isolate. The absence of d-alanine in the LTA of the dltA deletion mutant was confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The wild-type strain and the deletion mutant did not show any significant differences in growth curve, morphology, or autolysis. However, the mutant produced significantly less biofilm when grown in the presence of 1{\%} glucose (51.1{\%} compared to that of the wild type); adhesion to eukaryotic cells was diminished. The mutant absorbed 71.1{\%} of the opsonic antibodies, while absorption with the wild type resulted in a 93.2{\%} reduction in killing. Sensitivity to several cationic antimicrobial peptides (polymyxin B, colistin, and nisin) was considerably increased in the mutant strain, confirming similar results from other studies of gram-positive bacteria. Our data suggest that the absence of d-alanine in LTA plays a role in environmental interactions, probably by modulating the net negative charge of the bacterial cell surface, and therefore it may be involved in the pathogenesis of this organism.},

abstract = {Cationic antimicrobial peptides (CAMPs) serve as the first line of defense of the innate immune system against invading microbial pathogens. Gram-positive bacteria can resist CAMPs by modifying their anionic teichoic acids (TAs) with D-alanine, but the exact mechanism of resistance is not fully understood. Here, we utilized various functional and biophysical approaches to investigate the interactions of the human pathogen Group B Streptococcus (GBS) with a series of CAMPs having different properties. The data reveal that: (i) D-alanylation of lipoteichoic acids (LTAs) enhance GBS resistance only to a subset of CAMPs and there is a direct correlation between resistance and CAMPs length and charge density; (ii) resistance due to reduced anionic charge of LTAs is not attributed to decreased amounts of bound peptides to the bacteria; and (iii) D-alanylation most probably alters the conformation of LTAs which results in increasing the cell wall density, as seen by Transmission Electron Microscopy, and reduces the penetration of CAMPs through the cell wall. Furthermore, Atomic Force Microscopy reveals increased surface rigidity of the cell wall of the wild-type GBS strain to more than 20-fold that of the dltA mutant. We propose that D-alanylation of LTAs confers protection against linear CAMPs mainly by decreasing the flexibility and permeability of the cell wall, rather than by reducing the electrostatic interactions of the peptide with the cell surface. Overall, our findings uncover an important protective role of the cell wall against CAMPs and extend our understanding of mechanisms of bacterial resistance.},

Several mutants with increased sensitivity were obtained, which exhibited an altered structure of teichoic acids, major components of the Gram-positive cell wall. The mutant teichoic acids lacked D-alanine, as a result of which the cells carried an increased negative surface charge. The mutant cells bound fewer anionic, but more positively charged proteins. They were sensitive to human defensin HNP1-3, animal-derived protegrins, tachyplesins, and magainin II, and to the bacteria-derived peptides gallidermin and nisin. The mutated genes shared sequence similarity with the dlt genes involved in the transfer of D-alanine into teichoic acids from other Gram-positive bacteria. Wild-type strains bearing additional copies of the dlt operon produced teichoic acids with higher amounts of D-alanine esters, bound cationic proteins less effectively and were less sensitive to antimicrobial peptides. We propose a role of the D-alanine-esterified teichoic acids which occur in many pathogenic bacteria in the protection against human and animal defense systems.},

abstract = {Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are gaining attention as substitutes for antibiotics in order to combat the risk posed by multi-drug resistant pathogens. Several research groups are engaged in design of potent anti-infective agents using natural AMPs as templates. In this study, a library of peptides with high sequence similarity to Myeloid Antimicrobial Peptide (MAP) family were screened using popular online prediction algorithms. These peptide variants were designed in a manner to retain the conserved residues within the MAP family. The prediction algorithms were found to effectively classify peptides based on their antimicrobial nature. In order to improve the activity of the identified peptides, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, using bilayer and micellar systems could be used to design and predict effect of residue substitution on membranes of microbial and mammalian cells. The inference from MD simulation studies well corroborated with the wet-lab observations indicating that MD-guided rational design could lead to discovery of potent AMPs. The effect of the residue substitution on membrane activity was studied in greater detail using killing kinetic analysis. Killing kinetics studies on Gram-positive, negative and human erythrocytes indicated that a single residue change has a drastic effect on the potency of AMPs. An interesting outcome was a switch from monophasic to biphasic death rate constant of Staphylococcus aureus due to a single residue mutation in the peptide.},

abstract = {Pseudomonas aeruginosa is particularly difficult to treat because it possesses a variety of resistance mechanisms and because it often forms biofilms. Antimicrobial peptides represent promising candidates for future templates of antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections due to their unique mechanism of antimicrobial action. In this study, we first found that the antimicrobial peptide Feleucin-K3 has potent antimicrobial activity against not only the standard strain of P. aeruginosa but also against the multidrug-resistant strains isolated from clinics. Then, the structure-activity relationship of the peptide was investigated using alanine and D-amino acid scanning. Among the analogs synthesized, FK-1D showed much more potent antimicrobial activity, superior stability, and very low toxicity, and it was able to permeabilize bacterial membranes. Furthermore, it exhibited significant anti-biofilm activity. More importantly, FK-1D showed excellent antimicrobial activity in vivo, especially against clinical multidrug-resistant bacteria, in contrast to ceftazidime. Our results suggested that FK-1D could be subjected to fixed-point modification in the first and fourth sites to further optimize its medicinal properties and potential as a lead compound for the treatment of infections caused by multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa and the associated biofilms.},

abstract = {The increasing resistance of bacteria and fungi to the available antibiotic/antimycotic drugs urges for a search for new anti-infective compounds with new modes of action. In line of this, natural CAMPs represent promising and attractive candidates. Special attention has been devoted to frog-skin temporins, because of their short size (10-14 residues long) and their unique features. In particular, temporin-1Ta has the following properties: (i) it is mainly active on Gram-positive bacteria; (ii) it can synergize, when combined with temporin-1Tl, in inhibiting both gram-negative bacterial growth and the toxic effect of LPS; (iii) it preserves biological activity in the presence of serum; and (iv) it is practically not hemolytic. Rational design of CAMPs represents a straightforward approach to obtain a peptide with a better therapeutic index. Here, we used alanine scanning analogs to elucidate the contribution of the side chains of each amino acid residue to the peptide's antimicrobial and hemolytic activity. Beside providing insight into the biophysical attributes and the critical positions within the peptide sequence, which govern the antimicrobial/hemolytic activity of this temporin isoform, our studies assist in optimizing the design of temporin-based lead structures for the production of new anti-infective agents.},

abstract = {Short antimicrobial host-defense peptides represent a possible alternative as lead structures to fight antibiotic resistant bacterial infections. Bac2A is a 12-mer linear variant of the naturally occurring bovine host defense peptide, bactenecin, and demonstrates moderate, broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria as well as against the yeast Candida albicans. With the assistance of a method involving peptide synthesis on a cellulose support, the primary sequence requirements for antimicrobial activity against the human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa of 277 Bac2A variants were investigated by using a luciferase-based assay. Sequence scrambling of Bac2A led to activities ranging from superior or equivalent to Bac2A to inactive, indicating that good activity was not solely dependent on the composition of amino acids or the overall charge or hydrophobicity, but rather required particular linear sequence patterns. A QSAR computational analysis was applied to analyze the data resulting in a model that supported this sequence pattern hypothesis. The activity of selected peptides was confirmed by conventional minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) analyses with a panel of human pathogen bacteria and fungi. Circular-dichroism (CD) spectroscopy with selected peptides in liposomes and membrane depolarization assays were consistent with a relationship between structure and activity. An additional optimization process was performed involving systematic amino acid substitutions of one of the optimal scrambled peptide variants, resulting in superior active peptide variants. This process provides a cost and time effective enrichment of new candidates for drug development, increasing the chances of finding pharmacologically relevant peptides.},

Previous researches have demonstrated that symmetrical distribution patterns of amino acids contribute to the antimicrobial activity of natural peptides. However, there is little research describing such design ideas for synthetic $\alpha$-helical peptides. Therefore, here, we established a centrosymmetric $\alpha$-helical sequence template (y + hhh + y)n (h, hydrophobic amino acid; +, cationic amino acid; y, Gly or hydrophobic amino acid), which contributed to amphipathicity, and a series of centrosymmetric peptides was designed with pairs of small amino acids (Ala and Gly), which were utilized to modulate the biological activity. The centrosymmetric peptides with 3 repeat units exhibited strong antimicrobial activity; in particular, the Gly-rich centrosymmetric peptide GG3 showed stronger selectivity for gram-negative bacteria without hemolysis. Furthermore, beyond our expectation, fluorescence spectroscopy and electron microscopy analyses indicated that the GG3, which possessed poor $\alpha$-helix conformation, dramatically exhibited marked membrane destruction via inducing bacterial membrane permeabilization, pore formation and disruption, even bound DNA to further exert antimicrobial activity. Collectively, the Gly-rich centrosymmetric peptide GG3 was an ideal candidate for commercialization as a clinical therapeutic to treat gram-negative bacterial infections.},

Despite their various mechanisms of action, the interaction of AMPs with the bacterial cell membrane is the key step for their mode of action. Moreover, it is generally accepted that the membrane is the primary target of most AMPs, and the interaction between AMPs and eukaryotic cell membranes (causing toxicity to host cells) limits their clinical application. Therefore, researchers are engaged in reforming or de novo designing AMPs as a 'single-edged sword' that contains high antimicrobial activity yet low cytotoxicity against eukaryotic cells. To improve the antimicrobial activity of AMPs, the relationship between the structure and function of AMPs has been rigorously pursued.

abstract = {Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) secreted by the innate immune system are prevalent as the effective first-line of defense to overcome recurring microbial invasions. They have been widely accepted as the blueprints for the development of new antimicrobial agents for the treatment of drug resistant infections. However, there is also a growing concern that AMPs with a sequence that is too close to the host organism's AMP may inevitably compromise its own natural defense. In this study, we design a series of synthetic (non-natural) short $\alpha$-helical AMPs to expand the arsenal of the AMP families and to gain further insights on their antimicrobial activities. These cationic and amphiphilic peptides have a general sequence of (XXYY)(n) (X: hydrophobic residue, Y: cationic residue, and n: the number of repeat units), and are designed to mimic the folding behavior of the naturally-occurring $\alpha$-helical AMPs. The synthetic $\alpha$-helical AMPs with 3 repeat units, (FFRR)(3), (LLRR)(3), and (LLKK)(3), are found to be more selective towards microbial cells than rat red blood cells, with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values that are more than 10 times lower than their 50{\%} hemolytic concentrations (HC(50)). They are effective against Gram-positive B. subtilis and yeast C. albicans; and the studies using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) have elucidated that these peptides possess membrane-lytic activities against microbial cells. Furthermore, non-specific immune stimulation assays of a typical peptide shows negligible IFN-$\alpha$, IFN-$\gamma$, and TNF-$\alpha$ inductions in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, which implies additional safety aspects of the peptide for both systemic and topical use. Therefore, the peptides designed in this study can be promising antimicrobial agents against the frequently-encountered Gram-positive bacteria- or yeast-induced infections.},

abstract = {Comparison of human immunodeficiency virus lentiviral lytic peptide 1 with other host-derived peptides indicates that antimicrobial properties of membrane-active peptides are markedly influenced by their cationic, hydrophobic, and amphipathic properties. Many common themes, such as Arg composition of the cationic face of an amphipathic helix and the importance of maintaining the hydrophobic face, have been deduced from these observations. These studies suggest that a peptide with these structural properties can be derived de novo by using only a few strategically positioned amino acids. However, the effects of length and helicity on antimicrobial activity and selectivity have not been objectively evaluated in the context of this motif. To address these structure-function issues, multimers of a 12-residue lytic base unit (LBU) peptide composed only of Arg and Val residues aligned to form idealized amphipathic helices were designed. Bacterial killing assays and circular dichroism analyses reveal a strong correlation between antibacterial activity, peptide length, and propensity to form a helix in solvent mimicking the environment of a membrane. Increasing peptide length beyond two LBUs (24-residue peptides) resulted in no appreciable increase in antimicrobial activity. Derivatives (WLBU) of the LBU series were further engineered by substituting Trp residues in the hydrophobic domains. The 24-residue WLBU2 peptide was active at physiologic NaCl concentrations against Staphylococcus aureus and mucoid and nonmucoid strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Further, WLBU2 displayed the highest antibacterial selectivity of all peptides evaluated in the present study by using a coculture model of P. aeruginosa and primary human skin fibroblasts. These findings provide fundamental information toward the de novo design of an antimicrobial peptide useful for the management of infectious diseases.},

The goal of this study was to take a broad-spectrum, 26-residue, antimicrobial peptide in the all-D conformation, peptide D1 (K13) with excellent biologic properties and address the question of whether a rational design approach could be used to enhance the biologic properties if the focus was on Gram-negative pathogens only. To test this hypothesis, we used 11 and 6 diverse strains of Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, respectively. We optimized the number and location of positively charged residues on the polar face, the number, location, and type of hydrophobe on the non-polar face and varied the number of 'specificity determinants' in the center of the non-polar face from 1 to 2 to develop four new antimicrobial peptides. We demonstrated not only improvements in antimicrobial activity, but also dramatic reductions in hemolytic activity and unprecedented improvements in therapeutic indices. Compared to our original starting peptide D1 (V13), peptide D16 had a 746-fold improvement in hemolytic activity (i.e. decrease), maintained antimicrobial activity, and improved the therapeutic indices by 1305-fold and 895-fold against A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa, respectively. The resulting therapeutic indices for D16 were 3355 and 895 for A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa, respectively.

abstract = {We report on the synthesis, biological function, and a plausible mode of action of a new group of lipopeptides with potent antifungal and antibacterial activities. These lipopeptides are derived from positively charged peptides containing d- and l-amino acids (diastereomers) that are palmitoylated (PA) at their N terminus. The peptides investigated have the sequence K(4)X(7)W, where X designates Gly, Ala, Val, or Leu (designated d-X peptides). The data revealed that PA-d-G and PA-d-A gained potent antibacterial and antifungal activity despite the fact that both parental peptides were completely devoid of any activity toward microorganisms and model phospholipid membranes. In contrast, PA-d-L lost the potent antibacterial activity of the parental peptide but gained and preserved partial antifungal activity. Interestingly, both d-V and its palmitoylated analog were inactive toward bacteria, and only the palmitoylated peptide was highly potent toward yeast. Both PA-d-L and PA-d-V lipopeptides were also endowed with hemolytic activity. Mode of action studies were performed by using tryptophan fluorescence and attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared and circular dichroism spectroscopy as well as transmembrane depolarization assays with bacteria and fungi. The data suggest that the lipopeptides act by increasing the permeability of the cell membrane and that differences in their potency and target specificity are the result of differences in their oligomeric state and ability to dissociate and insert into the cytoplasmic membrane. These results provide insight regarding a new approach of modulating hydrophobicity and the self-assembly of non-membrane interacting peptides in order to endow them with both antibacterial and antifungal activities urgently needed to combat bacterial and fungal infections.},

abstract = {To investigate the importance of increased hydrophobicity at the amino end of antimicrobial peptides, a dermaseptin derivative was used as a template for a systematic acylation study. Through a gradual increase of the acyl moiety chain length, hydrophobicity was monitored and further modulated by acyl conversion to aminoacyl. The chain lengths of the acyl derivatives correlated with a gradual increase in the peptide's global hydrophobicity and stabilization of its helical structure. The effect on cytolytic properties, however, fluctuated for different cells. Whereas acylation gradually enhanced hemolysis of human red blood cells and antiprotozoan activity against Leishmania major, bacteria displayed a more complex behavior. The gram-positive organism Staphylococcus aureus was most sensitive to intermediate acyl chains, while longer acyls gradually led to a total loss of activity. All acyl derivatives were detrimental to activity against Escherichia coli, namely, but not solely, because of peptide aggregation. Although aminoacyl derivatives behaved essentially similarly to the nonaminated acyls, they displayed reduced hydrophobicity, and consequently, the long-chain acyls enhanced activity against all microorganisms (e.g., by up to 12-fold for the aminolauryl derivative) but were significantly less hemolytic than their acyl counterparts. Acylation also enhanced bactericidal kinetics and peptide resistance to plasma proteases. The similarities and differences upon acylation of MSI-78 and LL37 are presented and discussed. Overall, the data suggest an approach that can be used to enhance the potencies of acylated short antimicrobial peptides by preventing hydrophobic interactions that lead to self-assembly in solution and, thus, to inefficacy against cell wall-containing target cells.},

Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) represent promising alternatives to conventional antibiotics. AMPs are versatile, have almost unlimited sequence space, and can be tuned for broad-spectrum or specific activity against microorganisms. However, several obstacles remain to be overcome in order to develop AMPs for medical use, such as toxicity, stability, and bacterial resistance. We lack standard experimental procedures for quantifying AMP activity and do not yet have a clear picture of the mechanisms of action of AMPs. The rational design of AMPs can help solve these issues and enable their use as new antimicrobials. Here we provide an overview of the main physicochemical features that can be engineered to achieve enhanced bioactivity and describe current strategies being used to design AMPs.},

abstract = {Penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), the primary targets for $\beta$-lactam antibiotics, are periplasmic membrane-attached proteins responsible for the construction and maintenance of the bacterial cell wall. Bacteria have developed several mechanisms of resistance, one of which is the mutation of the target enzymes to reduce their affinity for $\beta$-lactam antibiotics. Here, we describe the structure of PBP2x from Streptococcus pneumoniae determined to 2.4 {\AA}. In addition, we also describe the PBP2x structure in complex with cefuroxime, a therapeutically relevant antibiotic, at 2.8 {\AA}. Surprisingly, two antibiotic molecules are observed: one as a covalent complex with the active-site serine residue, and a second one between the C-terminal and the transpeptidase domains. The structure of PBP2x reveals an active site similar to those of the class A $\beta$-lactamases, albeit with an absence of unambiguous deacylation machinery. The structure highlights a few amino acid residues, namely Thr338, Thr550 and Gln552, which are directly related to the resistance phenomenon.},

Antimicrobial peptides represent a promising new class of antibiotics. Here we ask whether it is possible to make small broad spectrum peptides employing minimal assumptions, by capitalizing on accumulating chemical biology information. Using peptide array technology, two large random 9-amino-acid peptide libraries were iteratively created using the amino acid composition of the most active peptides. The resultant data was used together with Artificial Neural Networks, a powerful machine learning technique, to create quantitative in silico models of antibiotic activity. On the basis of random testing, these models proved remarkably effective in predicting the activity of 100,000 virtual peptides. The best peptides, representing the top quartile of predicted activities, were effective against a broad array of multidrug-resistant "Superbugs" with activities that were equal to or better than four highly used conventional antibiotics, more effective than the most advanced clinical candidate antimicrobial peptide, and protective against Staphylococcus aureus infections in animal models.},

abstract = {Importance Oncolytic viruses (OVs) are emerging as important agents in cancer treatment. Oncolytic viruses offer the attractive therapeutic combination of tumor-specific cell lysis together with immune stimulation, therefore acting as potential in situ tumor vaccines. Moreover, OVs can be engineered for optimization of tumor selectivity and enhanced immune stimulation and can be readily combined with other agents. The effectiveness of OVs has been demonstrated in many preclinical studies and recently in humans, with US Food and Drug Administration approval of the oncolytic herpesvirus talimogene laherparepvec in advanced melanoma, a major breakthrough for the field. Thus, the OV approach to cancer therapy is becoming more interesting for scientists, clinicians, and the public. The main purpose of this review is to give a basic overview of OVs in clinical development and provide a description of the current status of clinical trials. Observations In 2016 approximately 40 clinical trials are recruiting patients, using a range of OVs in multiple cancer types. There are also many more trials in the planning stages. Therefore, we are now in the most active period of clinical OV studies in the history of the field. There are several OVs currently being tested with many additional engineered derivatives. In OV clinical trials, there are a number of specific areas that should be considered, including viral pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, potential toxic effects, and monitoring of the patients' immune status. Clinical development of OVs is increasingly focused on their immune stimulatory properties, which may work synergistically with immune checkpoint inhibitors and other strategies in the treatment of human cancer. Conclusions and Relevance Oncolytic viruses are an active area of clinical research. The ability of these agents to harness antitumor immunity appears to be key for their success. Combinatorial studies with immune checkpoint blockade have started and the results are awaited with great interest.},

@article{Oldfield1993,
abstract = {Malignant brain tumors are responsible for significant morbidity and mortality in both pediatric and adult populations. These common tumors present an enormous therapeutic challenge due to their poor outcome despite radical surgery, high dose radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Survival of patients from the time of diagnosis is measured in months and recurrence after treatment is associated with a life expectancy of weeks. In an attempt to improve this grim prognosis of patients with malignant brain tumors (both primary tumors and secondary metastasis from systemic cancer such as melanoma, lung and breast cancer), we have developed a novel approach to the therapy of brain tumors. This approach makes use of recombinant DNA technology to transfer a sensitivity gene into a brain tumor. This is achieved by direct injection of the tumor with a cell line actively producing a retroviral vector carrying a gene conferring drug sensitivity to the tumor. A retroviral vector is a mouse retrovirus genetically engineered to replace its own genes with a new gene. Such vectors are capable of "infecting" mammalian cells and stably incorporate their new genetic material into the genome of the infected host. The producer cell is an NIH 3T3 cell that has been genetically engineered to continually produce retroviral vectors. The new gene is incorporated into the genome of the tumor cells and expresses the protein which is encoded by the new gene. This protein (the herpes simplex virus enzyme thymidine kinase, HS-tk) sensitizes the tumor cells to an antiviral drug (ganciclovir, GCV) which is a natural substrate for HS-tk. The enzymatic process induced by GCV leads to death of the cell expressing the herpes TK activity, i.e., death of the tumor cells. Since the HS-tk enzyme which is normally present in mammalian cells has very low affinity for GCV, systemic toxicity related to this mechanism is not observed. This type of in vivo gene transfer has several unique features. First, these retroviral-vectors will only integrate and express their genes in cells which are actively synthesizing DNA. Therefore, surrounding non-proliferating normal brain tissue should not acquire the HS-tk gene and will remain insensitive to GCV. Second, all of the transduced tumor cells (and retroviral vector producing cells) will be killed by the host immune response and/or GCV treatment eliminating potential concern about insertional mutagenesis giving rise to malignant cells. This is the first clinical attempt to treat malignant tumors in human beings by in-vivo genetic manipulation of the tumor's genome.},

CRISPR/Cas9 comprises of a nonspecific Cas9 nuclease and a set of programmable sequence-specific CRISPR RNA (crRNA), which can guide Cas9 to cleave DNA and generate double-strand breaks at target sites. Subsequent cellular DNA repair process leads to desired insertions, deletions or substitutions at target sites. The specificity of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated DNA cleavage requires target sequences matching crRNA and a protospacer adjacent motif locating at downstream of target sequences. Here, we review the molecular mechanism, applications and challenges of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing and clinical therapeutic potential of CRISPR/Cas9 in future.},

This DNA-encoded, RNA-mediated defense system provides sequence-specific recognition, targeting and degradation of exogenous nucleic acid. Though the primary established role of CRISPR-Cas systems is in bona fide adaptive antiviral defense in bacteria, a growing body of evidence indicates that it also plays critical functional roles beyond immunity, such as endogenous transcriptional control. Furthermore, benefits inherent to maintaining genome homeostasis also come at the cost of reduced uptake of beneficial DNA, and preventing strategic adaptation to the environment. This opens new avenues for the investigation of CRISPR-Cas systems and their functional characterization beyond adaptive immunity.},

The action of lactoferrin seemed to be specific, because it could be abolished by simultaneous addition of antilactoferrin antibody. Addition of transferrin and iron salts to PMN was without effect. Between iron-poor and iron-saturated lactoferrin there was no difference in influence on PMN function except for a higher FMLP stimulated superoxide production by iron-saturated lactoferrin. Aggregation, degranulation (beta-glucuronidase, lysozyme), and bacterial killing were not influenced by lactoferrin. Incubation of monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages with lactoferrin did not alter their motility or their superoxide production rates. Our findings indicate that PMN become more effective after exposure to lactoferrin by having a greater motility and producing superoxide at a faster rate.},

Peptides (12 or 16 aa in length) with four different turn sequences are monomeric and fold cooperatively in water, as has been observed previously for some hairpin peptides. However, the folding free energies of the trpzips exceed substantially those of all previously reported $\beta$-hairpins and even those of some larger designed proteins. NMR structures of three of the trpzip peptides reveal exceptionally well-defined $\beta$-hairpin conformations stabilized by cross-strand pairs of indole rings. The trpzips are the smallest peptides to adopt an unique tertiary fold without requiring metal binding, unusual amino acids, or disulfide crosslinks.

A single active peptide representing this domain was isolated following gastric pepsin cleavage of human lactoferrin, and bovine lactoferrin, and sequenced by automated Edman degradation. The antimicrobial sequence was found to consist mainly of a loop of 18 amino acid residues formed by a disulfide bond between cysteine residues 20 and 37 of human lactoferrin, or 19 and 36 of bovine lactoferrin. Synthetic analogs of this region similarly exhibited potent antibacterial properties. The active peptide of bovine lactoferrin was more potent than that of human lactoferrin having effectiveness against various Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria at concentrations between 0.3 $\mu$M and 3.0 $\mu$M, depending on the target strain. The effect of the isolated domain was lethal causing a rapid loss of colony-forming capability. Our studies suggest this domain is the structural region responsible for the bactericidal properties of lactoferrin.},

The present study demonstrates variable susceptibilities for a variety of different microorganisms. The list of susceptible organisms includes gram-positive and gram-negative microbes, rods and cocci, facultative anaerobes, and aerotolerant anaerobes. Similar morphological and physiological types are represented among the lalctoferrin-resistant bacteria. S. mutans was more resistant to lactoferrin when grown on a sucrose-contaning medium than when it was grown on brain heart infusion broth without added scurose. When a lactoferrin-sensitive, avirulent strain of Streptococcus pneumoniae was passed through mice, the resultant virulent culture became lactoferrin resistant. Since organisms of the same species and even of the same strain (S. pneumoniae) can differ in susceptibility to lactoferrin, it appears that accessibility to the lactoferrin target site may account for differences in susceptibility. It appears that there may be a relation between virulence and resistance to lactoferrin.},

abstract = {This review focuses on important structural features affecting the antimicrobial activity of 15-residue derivatives of lactoferricins. Our investigations are based on an alanine-scan of a 15-residue bovine lactoferricin derivative that revealed the absolute necessity of two tryptophan residues for antimicrobial activity. This "tryptophan-effect" was further explored in homologous derivatives of human, caprine, and porcine lactoferricins by the incorporation of one additional tryptophan residue, and by increasing the content of tryptophan in the bovine derivative to five residues. Most of the resulting peptides display a substantial increase in antimicrobial activity. To identify which molecular properties make tryptophan so effective, a series of bovine lactoferricin derivatives were prepared containing non-encoded unnatural aromatic amino acids, which represented various aspects of the physicochemical nature of tryptophan. The results clearly demonstrate that tryptophan is not unique since most of the modified peptides were of higher antimicrobial potency than the native peptide. The size and three-dimensional shape of the inserted "super-tryptophans" are the most important determinants for the high antimicrobial activity of the modified peptides. This review also describes the use of a "soft-modeling" approach in order to identify important structural parameters affecting the antimicrobial activity of modified 15-residue murine lactoferricin derivatives. This QSAR-study revealed that the net charge, charge asymmetry, and micelle affinity of the peptides were the most important structural parameters affecting their antimicrobial activity.},

The problem is exacerbated by a lack of sufficient experimental detail in many publications, which impedes a reader's ability to evaluate critically the quality of the results presented or to repeat the experiments. CONTENT The Minimum Information for Publication of Quantitative Real-Time PCR Experiments (MIQE) guidelines target the reliability of results to help ensure the integrity of the scientific literature, promote consistency between laboratories, and increase experimental transparency. MIQE is a set of guidelines that describe the minimum information necessary for evaluating qPCR experiments. Included is a checklist to accompany the initial submission of a manuscript to the publisher. By providing all relevant experimental conditions and assay characteristics, reviewers can assess the validity of the protocols used. Full disclosure of all reagents, sequences, and analysis methods is necessary to enable other investigators to reproduce results. MIQE details should be published either in abbreviated form or as an online supplement. SUMMARY Following these guidelines will encourage better experimental practice, allowing more reliable and unequivocal interpretation of qPCR results.},

@article{Crombez2009,
abstract = {RNA interference constitutes a powerful tool for biological studies, but has also become one of the most challenging therapeutic strategies. However, small interfering RNA (siRNA)-based strategies suffer from their poor delivery and biodistribution. Cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) have been shown to improve the intracellular delivery of various biologically active molecules into living cells and have more recently been applied to siRNA delivery. To improve cellular uptake of siRNA into challenging cell lines, we have designed a secondary amphipathic peptide (CADY) of 20 residues combining aromatic tryptophan and cationic arginine residues. CADY adopts a helical conformation within cell membranes, thereby exposing charged residues on one side, and Trp groups that favor cellular uptake on the other. We show that CADY forms stable complexes with siRNA, thereby increasing their stability and improving their delivery into a wide variety of cell lines, including suspension and primary cell lines. CADY-mediated delivery of subnanomolar concentrations of siRNA leads to significant knockdown of the target gene at both the mRNA and protein levels. Moreover, we demonstrate that CADY is not toxic and enters cells through a mechanism which is independent of the major endosomal pathway. Given its biological properties, we propose that CADY-based technology will have a significant effect on the development of fundamental and therapeutic siRNA-based applications.},
